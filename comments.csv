Comment,me6ezj,gsdzzz0,t3_me6ezj,Liteboyy,"['So there’s 2 main differences between a warrant and a call/put option. \n\n- a company issues the warrants \n\n- said company issues new shares if the warrant is exercised \n\nELI5: options are between you and another party, usually the MM. You pay a premium to reserve a price point in the future to buy or sell a stock at, regardless of the price of the stock. When you get a warrant, the *company* issues you the warrant, and if you exercise it the company issues you new shares and they make profit. A MM is delta hedged and not trying to profit or lose from their position, so a warrant is more beneficial to a company directly. It’s basically an option but with the company itself. \n\nHow do you make money from this mistake? You have 2 choices. You wait for the price of the stock to get closer to your strike price, and sell the warrant for a profit. Or wait for the stock price to go past your strike price, exercise the warrant to buy the stock at your price and then sell it for the market price.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards!']",,,False,854,[1616822889.0]

This timing is similar to the recent nasdaq fall but there's enough differences to where I'm not seeing high correlation.\n\nSo, why is it sliding and can it recover? If I could get comfortable with it recovering to above $18.90 within the next year, I'd just hold. Hell, I might hold anyway just to remind myself of the mistake.

Some of these are outright index funds.  Others use some sort of rule based allocation strategy.  Some pretend to be actively traded but are in reality passively investing.  This percent of the market is a lot larger than is given credit.  There is no price discovery for these purchases.\n\nSecond, most actively traded funds have to deal with business realities of running a fund.  I will give you a case in point.  I like to put Aswath Damodaran's valuation courses on while I work on various things.  He always brings various happenings in the current market into his lectures.  Recently he had this anecdote: In his investment philosophy class he had an Indian fund manager tell the class he was facing an existential crisis.  He believed in value investing but could not find anything to buy in the Indian market, and his fund was restricted to buying Indian stocks.  Everything seems to be overvalued.  If he kept to his beliefs he could not buy anything, but managers in competing funds would continue to buy overvalued stocks, riding them upward, performing better than him, and he would soon be out of a job.  If he wanted to save his job then he needed to abandon his beliefs and go along with everyone else; when the market finally corrects, he will not look any different from the other managers.  The point is the big actively traded funds are under pressures that force them to pursue less than optimal strategies.  There are very few managers who are in the position of Buffet who can sit for years on a mountain of cash waiting for the perfect opportunity.  \n\nMost funds live and die based on their results for the last year or last few years, and market cycles are longer than that.  The investment strategy that looks great for a few years may be very sub optimal over the long term.  There is a long list of funds and traders who perform fantastic using high risk/high reward strategies then crash and burn when the market turns.  See the ARK funds for an example.  If you are cynical about it then you can think the fund managers know exactly what they are doing: use risky investments to perform well in the short term, use the over performance to grow the AUM, and collect those fees; after the whole thing melts down, close the fund, and enjoy the millions you were paid to recklessly gamble with the clients money.""]",,,False,2,[1616813338.0]

The lower risk premium would mean a larger valuation on the stock, however it is less volatile (aka it has been ""priced in""), however the greater the risk premium the stock valuation may be smaller, however it is subject to volatility and uncertainty.\n\nHoped this helped. Happy trading. Here is the full equation below. It is called the DDM model i believe. If you are curious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrice\\_s = (Divident\\_today + Expected dividend growth) / (Risk free interest rate + risk premium - expected dividend growth)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGL! And Happy trading!\n\nQuick note: It is important to note that investments in stock often time do not follow the classical model of supply and demand. Thus ""true"" ""pricing in"" is impossible because there is no equilibrium. Stock often work in a positive feed back loop where a few sell offs could result in a large sell off, and similarly few buy off could also turn into large buy offs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo a recent case study could be Microsoft acquiring Bethesda Studios. People can price in the new acquisition (Net worth Microsoft + Net worth Bethesda - Cost in acquiring Bethesda). However it doesn\'t consider risk in that acquisition which influences the stock valuation. So hearing news like ""Bethesda Game Studios Says Transition To Working Under Microsoft Has Been Smooth"" - (Gaming Bolt) may influence future prospects of Microsoft\'s stock value.']",,,False,1,[1616812797.0]

I\'ve got to run, but finding out what requirements are needed for them to be exercised under the equity compensation plans would be semi important.\n\n>As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,542,057,292 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, 249,077,252 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding  and 1,005,000 shares of our Class F common stock  outstanding.  Substantially  all  of these  shares  may be  immediately  sold.  Moreover,non-affiliates who have beneficially owned our Class A common stock for at least six months may rely on Rule 144 to sell their shares of Class A common stock, and our directors, executive officers, and other affiliates (including our Founders and their affiliates) who have beneficially owned our Class A common stock for at least six months are entitled to sell their shares of our Class A common stock subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Further, as of December 31, 2020, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 253,744,515 shares of our Class A common stock and 282,021,988 shares of our Class B common stock, 124,870,238 shares of our Class A common stock and 60,000,000 shares of Class B common stock subject to RSUs and 1,470,781 shares of our Class A common stock subject to growth units. All shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans have been registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and compliance by affiliates with Rule 144, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSUs and growth units will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\n\nEdit; Went and looked quickly for what I could find\n\n***2020 Equity Incentive Plan***\n\n>In September 2020, prior to the Direct Listing, the Company’s Board of  Directors approved the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). The  2020 Plan provides for the grant of ISOs, NSOs, restricted stock, RSUs,  SARs, and performance awards to the Company’s employees, directors, and consultants. A total  of 150,000,000 shares Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  of the Company’s Class\xa0A common stock are reserved for issuance pursuant  to the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of Class\xa0A common  stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan includes the number of shares of Class\xa0A common stock or  Class\xa0B common stock subject to awards under the Company’s Amended 2010  Equity Incentive Plan and Executive Equity Plan. Shares of Class\xa0B  common stock added to the 2020 Plan from the 2010 Plan or Executive Equity Plan are reserved  for issuance under the Company’s 2020 Plan as Class\xa0A common stock. The  number of shares of Class\xa0A common stock available for issuance under  the 2020 Plan will also include an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year  beginning on January\xa01, 2022, equal to the least of:\n\n* 250,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class\xa0A common stock;\n* Five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or\n* such other amount as the administrator of the 2020 Plan determines.\n\n>Under  the 2020 Plan, the exercise price of options granted is generally at  least equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Class\xa0A common stock on the date of grant. The term of an ISO generally  may not exceed ten years. Additionally, the exercise price of any ISO  granted to a 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the  estimated fair value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the term of such option grant shall not  exceed five years. Options and other equity awards become vested and, if  applicable, exercisable based on terms determined by the Board of  Directors or an other plan administrator on the date of grant, which is typically five years for  new employees and varies for subsequent grants.\n\nOptions\n\n>During  the nine months ended September\xa030, 2020, the Company modified  37,451,458 fully vested and outstanding options that were approaching expiration. The extension of the original options was  recorded as a stock option modification whereby the incremental fair  value of each option was determined at the date of the modification and  $9.4\xa0million was immediately recognized related to vested options. The weighted average extended term  for the modified options was approximately 0.46 years.  \n>  \n>In June 2020, the Company repriced 235,885,337 stock options. As part of the  repricing, the original options were canceled and new options were  granted with an exercise price of $4.72 per share and a remaining  contractual term of ten years. The new options were generally subject to the same service-based vesting schedule as the  original options. The repricing was recorded as a stock option  modification whereby the incremental fair value of each option was  determined at the date of the modification and $74.0\xa0million was immediately recognized related to vested options in  June 2020 and an additional $4.5\xa0million was recognized during the three  months ended September\xa030, 2020. As of September\xa030, 2020, there was  remaining incremental fair value of $27.0\xa0million which will be recognized over  the remaining requisite service period.\n\n***RSUs***\n\n>The following table summarizes the RSU activity for the nine months ended September\xa030, 2020: Unvested and outstanding at September\xa030, 2020 - 199,655,233  $ 6.69 The performance-based vesting condition for all RSUs was satisfied upon the  Company’s Direct Listing, September\xa030, 2020. Upon such satisfaction, 68,149,214 RSUs, for which  the service-based vesting condition was met as of such date, vested and  converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class\xa0A common stock.  As a result, the Company recognized $769.5\xa0million in cumulative stock-based compensation expense  using the accelerated attribution method from the grant date. **As of  September\xa030, 2020, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the RSUs outstanding was $1.0\xa0billion, which the Company expects to recognize  over 3.13 years.**\n\nDon\'t have time to really follow up or make sense of this atm, so here\'s the [prospectus](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520292188?cik=1321655). Seems like they\'re going to be paying out a lot of shares continued for the next few years. Wasn\'t the 769.5million stock base compensation noted in their 10k bringing them from profitable to way negative? I remember people mentioning that, and that number sounds right.']",,,False,15,[1616793731.0]

Comment,mdwibp,gscf2tx,t3_mdwibp,universal_language,"['My largest concern is that no one knows exactly how much useful Palantir products are.\n\nFor example, I worked with a product which was advertised ""Enables enterprise users to maximize productive collaboration while enhancing digital well-being"". Sounds cool, huh? But that\'s corporate bullshit, in fact it was just a browser extension, you could hover your coworker\'s email and the extension would show in a popup if that person is on vacation right now or is actually in the office. That\'s it.\n\nWe have the same load of bullshit about Palantir, it\'s written on their website, it was shown us on the demo day. So they presumably can automatically load all company\'s data, build an ontology and then use the AI to answer complex questions and power real-time decisions, bla-bla-bla. The question is, how much of that is true. If they indeed can load all data automatically and immediately say ""adjust that particular workflow and your company will save XX millions"", then the product is awesome and is totally worth hundreds of billions. The more likely scenario is that it\'s just a fancy dashboard, and the real decision is done by a smart person, who looks at that dashboard. The problem in that case is that the smart person doesn\'t really need a slick dashboard, they probably can come up with the same decision by looking at excel sheets. In that case the product is not worth a lot, and the company is overvalued even right now.\n\nI\'m an IT engineer, and my experience says that the probability of the second scenario is much higher, so fundamentally I\'m bearish. On the other hand, I hold a large position in Palantir and will add more to it in the future, because I do not trust that an average Joe will understand the problem - I think the majority of people will easily get fooled by words like AI and ML and cool demos. The actual misconception will not be uncovered in next few years at least, because I\'m pretty sure that Palantir clients sign an NDA. And in general, no company will easily admit that they\'ve spent several millions on a fancy dashboard.

Comment,mdybx4,gsdaavp,t1_gsc6ivy,InitializedVariable,"['That’s what I’d say. If you’re going to day trade, that’s ones own decision to make. But I’d argue that part of being successful with that approach is to not have your money exposed, especially in terms of multiple days.\n\nAlso, plenty of stocks held strong. If you’re going to day trade, you should be playing volatility, and there’s often plenty of stocks that are going up even when the general sentiment is that it’s a bad day.\n\nBy the way, I don’t endorse day trading, especially for someone who is new to the markets or doesn’t have time to make it their primary focus. I also don’t condemn it — it’s your decision.\n\nIf you’re new, I would recommend starting by investing. Find stocks and funds you have faith in for the long-term (think in terms of years).\n\nMake a plan for how you will add to this set of holdings over time. I’d recommend that you periodically invest a consistent amount of money on a consistent schedule (e.g., 200 dollars every payday) — basically, DCA.\n\nYou should also determine your strategy for adding additional assets to this portfolio. If you find new stocks of interest, do you want to add them to your portfolio and divest some of your recurring investment amount towards them? Or, would you rather concentrate on a smaller number of holdings? Also, what will be your approach to weighting your portfolio?\n\nRegardless of your answers to these questions, make a plan and stick to it. If you feel like you need to make adjustments, that is fine, but it should involve careful consideration, and you shouldn’t stray from the strategy on a whim. Rather, you should change your plan if necessary, consistently apply it for a time, and then revisit it to determine if the results are acceptable.\n\nIf you want to make some more risky or short-term plays, that’s fine too. Along the same lines as stated above, define your strategy, and consistently apply it.']",,,False,6,[1616809469.0]

To tell you to live life and not worry so much about finances is bad advice from an internet stranger who isn’t invested in you long term.  Money is important and you need to be smart with it, but how strict you are is up to you.  \n\nMy strategy.  Just make sure the short, middle and long term buckets are full.\n\nShort term bucket: have your emergency fund in cash on hand.  Some say 3-6 months.  I keep one year.  I know it’s too much but when the markets tank in a bloody dumpster fire I’m not tempted to cash out.  I have plenty of cash on hand and shrug it off.  Got that, then move to the long term bucket. \nLong bucket: automate your 401k and IRA savings so that you are maxing out tax advantages accounts for retirements.  If you start early in life you’ll be set just off of these two. Once the tax advantages accounts are done work on the middle bucket.  \nWhen you are done paying your bills every month siphon off everything over your emergency fund amount into a brokerage account you could use/touch if you wanted/needed to.  \n\nOnce you have those three buckets flowing naturally every month just have fun in life.  You’re 21.  It’ll take time to get the full max on 401k and IrA down.  But once you’ve got that, it’s ride out life and enjoy it.  Don’t say sorry about hustling until those are set up though.  Nobody telling you to just enjoy life is gonna lend you a dime once you are retired.  Be proud of financial discipline in a world of debt.  But as many have said, just don’t talk about it.

Some peoples hobby is to go out for dinner 20$ a plate others enjoy cooking at home 10$ a plate. \n\nSome people enjoy reading business news to invest in businesses others watch TV news and are always mad or scared of the next earth destruction. \n\nIf you invest because you like it that’s wonderful. I think you are asking the wrong question. \n\nYou want to know if you are doing the right thing. \n\nAre you saving money and mad at life?Do you make others pay when you go out? Not tip servers?

If so you may be creating a habit of being cheap to invest to be rich at the end of the day that’s being cheap and all the money won’t make you happy.

I don’t go out to eat often, impulse buy Amazon stuff and rarely go to bars to drink.\n\nWhat’s your lifestyle. What do you enjoy and where do you sacrifice to save. Figure that out and if your not sacrificing what brings you joy you are good. \n\nPeople I work with collect shoes and think I’m crazy for collecting stocks. We all play basketball on Wednesdays I always wear the same shoes, some never wear the same shoes 2 times in a couple months.

They are less likely to view the domestic product as inferior to western imports and they like supporting their own industry. \n\nAll that applies to Chinese EVs in general but NIO have a couple things going on for it\n\nA) a cool battery swab technology \nB) a cult following that rivals that of Tesla with the company promoting an entire lifestyle around the vehicle and clubs for the owners, etc \n\nOn the other hand, we have no reason to believe Ford is going to get any additional market share, they are big, but they aren’t necessarily getting bigger, and they seem to be lagging behind in electrification to GM.

Ford had already signaled that they want to move out of the dealership and financing business and move into just 3rd party manufacturing. For years they've been figuring out how to cut corners in the manufacturing process to increase profit margins to the point that they stopped producing sedans. To me it signals that they lost interest in innovation. Combine this history with the declining sales and massive debt and they just look like a company that is not ready for the future. \n\nNIO has the manufacturing, sales/financing, NIO Service, NIO Power, NIO Life, NIO AI and they're aggressively working on autonomous driving. This company offers these all as a monthly service which shows more revenue opportunity in a country that is aggressively phasing out ICE vehicles. The NIO Power is not just the battery swap stations but includes chargers, power home and mobile charging station. During my initial research they looked like a EV parts manufacturer to me since they have their own battery, power train and motor factories. Soon they'll have their own car manufacturing facility. This doesn't include the partnerships that NIO has with VW and SINOPEC. Also, NIO and XPENG have both been dropping hints about a partnership, which combined would make them the top dog in China.""]",,,False,6,[1616791933.0]

I don't miss the dividend much, and am actually hoping they don't turn it back on, instead using it to reduce their debt and continue buying back shares.  I'd rather see the bump in LTCG from stock buyback, than a qualified dividend myself.  I like Ford's EV play, and think that they are the best position to capitalize on an emerging truck EV market (F series are the best selling vehicles in the US).\n\nThe EV play for Ford is not a sure thing, by any stretch of the imagination. Ford's debt is quite large, but their current ratio is 1.2, so it's not like they're drowning either.

So you sold at $9. You then rebuy at say $8 within 30 days triggering a wash sale. \n\nSo now your cost basis isn’t $8, the repurchase price, it’s instead $9, the original basis with the wash sale loss added to it of $1 per share. \n\nSo you actually bought it for $8 a share.

Of course not, you are \\*FORCED\\* to buy them at the price that people set. It isn\'t about what the market sets the price at.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, in theory if the brokers force you to buy the stock to cover and the price is P then they buy it at P then when they buy the shares what happens? THE PRICE GOES UP! Supply and demand but at that point there is only demand. The brokerages do not turn around and sell those shares for you because then that doesn\'t balance the equation. You then own that stock at the price P. But now P went up... and each time they buy the stock, if no one is selling the price P goes up. This is what happens during a short squeeze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe squeeze drives the price up higher and higher automatically. There is nothing stopping it EXCEPT when once the shorts are covered. Yes, people will be willing to sell there shares at some price which will limit the maximum P can reach.\n\nBUT there are two things:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If the shorters have shorted over 100% of the stock then, well, what happens once they were forced to buy 100% of the stock? Now there are still owners out there the ones that held out the longest. The price will be whatever at that time, say P, but since they are still holding the price will climb.   \nAt some point there is the last ""bagholder""... AND HE HAS TO BE BOUGHT OUT! But there are no more sellers to undercut him.   \nThis is unlike the cause when there are less than 100% shorted. The less shorted the stock is the more people can undercut each other.  \nE.g., Suppose ratio of r of the stock is shorted, and of the owners of the stock, there is a ratio of s of people who will sell early and the rest will have ""diamond hands"". Naturally these will actually be probability distributions but we can model them as simple thresholds and simplification to get the general picture:  \nLet P be the price of the stock and N the total shares. Now at forced buy in r\\*N must be covered. There are s\\*N sellers who will sell at some price P. They sell out. The shorters covered and the s\\*N sellers got their bank and the (1-s)\\*N are still holding the shares they own and we end up with some new lower price P(which might still be high depending on other factors or it might drop significantly, depends on the circumstances). (s - r)\\*N is the number of ""outstanding"" shares and s = r since it was forced to be so and so there are no outstanding shares after covering. The ""diamond hands"" group is (1 - s + (s - r))\\*N = (1 - r)\\*N. It\'s just the owners that are left ""holding the bag"" since they didn\'t sell out. r\\*N + (1 - r)\\*N = N the total shares. The shorts own r\\*N and the ""bag holders"" own (1-r)\\*N.  \nThat is the typical circumstance. Now if r > 1, we have the same except (1 - r)\\*N < 0!!!!!!!!!   \nTHIS IS A TEAR IN THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM! We the ""bag holders"" literally end up with less shares than they own. How is that possible? The stock market is essentially a zero sum game!\n2. The logic is simple: When shorted < 100% the shorters only have to buy back from a portion of the owners. When shorted > 100% the shorters have to buy back from EVERY owner. In this case there is zero competition. This is when the owners can set there price to be whatever it is.  \nThink about this using a simple example. Suppose there is one owner and the shorter(which is now a buyer) is forced to buy from that owner. Does the owner not get to set the price? Isn\'t that what forced means? What if there are two owners and the shorter has to buy 1 stock. He can play the two owners against each other. Greed, FUD, etc will play them against each other so that they want to sell before the other. This is how the ""normal"" markets work. If every long simply held and kept buying they could trap every shorter like this, but if the shorts are not over 100% they can always pit players against each other.\n3. So with GME or any stock that has been shorted past 100% by using naked short selling, FTDs, etc, it becomes mathematically impossible for them not to end up in the 1-1 case(reductively). They are forced to buy at the owners mercy at whatever price he sets.  This is just how it works. Everyone will sell out but technically anyone can set the price they want because they won\'t actually undercut anyone else since they are no longer competing to sell. It is 100% that they will get to sell. \n4. So the only two issues with GME are these: Have the shorters shorted more than 100%? If it\'s too much will they fuck over the owners in some way by using illegal means or using manipulation. If the owners can set their price to be anything, could they not say 1quadrillion per stock? They can, but if the seller can\'t afford it how can they truly force them? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, these, GME is relatively simple. If you believe the short interest is > 100% then buy at least one stock and you can bank on it. You might not be able to get 1 quadrillion. At some point everything breaks. That is because the shorts broke the fucking universe when they turned a zero-sum game in to a non-zero sum game. The universe must rectify the imbalance. The thing is, you really think the government and rich are going to give up their wealth for fucking up? You think the feds are going to print 10000 quintillion for GME? At some point the government sets something like ""We will give you 1000$ per share, take it or leave it""(they will calculate it out and try to screw retail. It might be 200$, it might be 25$ it might be 2000$). They might help rig the system so that the shorters somehow get out of it. E.g., they might force or bribe GS to dilute shares so that they push the short interest < 50% allowing shorters to win. They could come up with some scheme to make it all work. E.g., get some institutional owners to sell out to bring it down and get GS to dilute, etc and do a lot of other shit. They could try to bankrupt GS which makes it\'s shares go to zero.\n\nThe simple fact is that once they short over 100% it is game over(assuming they have to pay up). The problem is we don\'t know if they have. Supposedly there is at least 150% ownership of stock which means there\'s 50% fabricated shares. That is still quite guy. It means 1 in 2 are competing. The institutional investors can\'t sell all their stock at once since it drives price down so this is still good for small investors, it\'s ""almost"" like the 100% case but it limits the price, maybe 1000$ maybe 10000$. \n\nBut we know it is around at least 50%! But notice how the shorters are trying so hard to get the stock down and they can\'t really do it. Why do they try so hard? What about the FTDs? We know there are hundreds of thousands minimum as reported by the SEC. GME also only has 70M shares, about 50M float.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://fintel.io/fg/us/gme/SharesFloat](https://fintel.io/fg/us/gme/SharesFloat)\n\n[https://tiptopdaily.com/2021/02/07/gme-institutions-hold-177-of-float/](https://tiptopdaily.com/2021/02/07/gme-institutions-hold-177-of-float/)\n\n100B dollars worth of stock has been bought up in the last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Outstanding Shares**102,270,000 shares**Float Size**54,490,000 shares**Short Percent of Float**18.70% \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey say it its 18.7%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut basically there is 54M shares that are floating about, Supposed 144-177% are owned by institutions...

I don't think the first shoulder and head are as clear as you do. I'll use IWM for example. On the daily interval, the swing high on 2/9/21 was $228.38 at close. The next swing high was $234.42 at close on 3/15/21. That's not really a huge step up from the last high to form a head. If you zoom out on the 1-day chart, it barely looks like an increase at all. \n\nThere is a bearish case to be made in RSI divergence though. There is a pretty clear regular bearish divergence in the past few swing highs; as price reaches higher highs in an uptrend, the RSI is reaching lower highs. This can be indicative of a bearish reversal.\n\nHowever, there is a bullish case to be made with RSI divergences too. There is a hidden bullish divergence with the past few swing lows; as the price is reaching higher swing lows in an uptrend, the RSI is reaching lower lows. This can be indicative of a continuation of a bullish pattern.\n\nAnother thing to note is that all three of the index etfs you mentioned are trading way, way above a long term moving average (on the daily chart). I use an EMA200 and from early November to recently, the price has been getting further and further above the average. It can't continue like that forever, and often times after a long run, stocks will start to trade sideways and eventually consolidate around the long term moving average.  Considering the big run in the winter and the mixed signals from the rsi, it's possible that this could trade sideways for a few cycles and then break out later on. \n\nI'm not a huge believer in chart patterns without context, but the head and shoulders is one of the more reliable reversal patterns. That said, assuming the last two swings were a left shoulder and head, we still don't have a right shoulder yet. \n\nIf I had a position in any of those index etfs, I'd be waiting until I saw the next swing high and then a dip to the neckline. I'd be looking at my momentum indicators to see which, if any divergences continued, and then possibly setting a stop loss a little below the neckline. \n\nNot financial advice.

Don't get me wrong , momentum trading is fun and you can make (ALOT of) money but it's not that different than gambling at least for me. \n\nHumble yourself on actual fundamentals and how to value a business. Read the intelligent investor or some books from Peter Lynch. You need to know if u are buying something at a fair price , even if you love the company.

As a part of that, I had a 401k match and some stocks but I was pretty passive about things. Then the 2008 crash happened and I decided I really needed to understand this stuff well. I dove in, mostly watched YouTube videos and read a lot of articles videos and but I did talk a little with a few members if my family that were in it (this isn't really a big help, tbh I think a lot of advice was crap).\n\nI would make my own spreadsheets, do my own simulations, and started putting my money in.

Comment,me37ft,gseauvn,t3_me37ft,walder08,"['So this will probably be unpopular, but first, the fact that you have that much student debt shows the problem with our secondary education system and in my opinion, you should resist paying that back simply because it is a scam to begin with; however, if you still want to pay your loans while taking advantage of your money right now, here is my suggestion:\n\nFirst, many people here seem to not realize that being in debt actually is a really good way to make money.  Paying off your debts, oddly enough, is not always a good thing.  That’s not to say you shouldn’t, but let’s say you decide to pay off the loan upfront to remove the debt.  You now can’t make money off of your 184k at all, and essentially set yourself to zero, while paying your debt off slowly will allow you to make passive income off of what you currently hold.  Nearly all of the wealthiest people in the world love having debt because it allows them to make a lot of money, and while I’m not saying “take as much debt as you can get”, don’t be afraid of it.\n\nSecond, I would highly recommend researching into the wheel strategy.  The mentality that investing in a stock and waiting for it to grow over years is a very “traditional” response and isn’t always what people are looking for.  Additionally, right now is an amazing time to actually get into the market because things are so cheap.  By selling cash cover puts and covered calls, I’ve easily been able to make myself and my friend 10%+ returns per week with the only risk being that I lose my money if the companies I trade on go out of business, but that’s the same for anyone regardless of strategy.  Even during the last minor correction this/last month, and the one right now, I’ve been making money. You would have to learn how to pick the correct stocks for it as you can’t just do it with any stock, but it is a very profitable and safe strategy.\n\nMy personal recommendation is to use a portion of the money you have to sell cash cover puts (use only a small amount at first to verify the method works and you understand how to do it), then increase the amount as it becomes more comfortable.  I know that people will disagree with me here, but with that much money you could easily make enough money to pay off the loan in full if you really wanted to in a few months with very little risk.

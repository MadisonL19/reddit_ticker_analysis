Comment,m4inen,gququ0q,t3_m4inen,Justatadinconsistent,"['Ok, a couple of things, having handled estates and stock certificates before....\n1.  Call the investor relations for the company.  It is usually listed on the certificate, although they can change.  They are responsible for accounting of every outstanding share, and who owns it.  There should be a CUSIP number on the certificate that will help identify it.  They can tell you if it’s a duplicate (like they lost it along the way and had a replacement sent). \n2.  If the shares are actually owned by them (the certificate is legit) I would advise retaining an attorney and getting a good accountant at this point.  If you are the sole heir, and the estate is open still, it may be very wise to have the shares (maybe not all) cashed in by the estate.  This would establish a date of death (dod) valuation for the shares, and the estate would be liable for some taxes.  Depending on the total value of the estate, you may be able to inherit the balance “tax free”, making you only responsible for the gains since the DOD.  \n3.  Plan your investment strategy.  I would STRONGLY recommend that if you are not familiar with handling this amount of money, you seek out wise counsel.  I can’t tell you what that means for you, but it certainly isn’t following subreddits blindly into the abyss.  \n\nBest to you.\n\nThere is no substitute for a good accountant and a good attorney, one should have both employed.']",,False,301,[1615683289.0]

Comment,m4inen,gqwt1zg,t3_m4inen,TheDeringer,"[""Finally, something I can help with.\n\nOP, I work for a Stock Transfer Agent, not the agent for Meredith, but I can steer you in the right direction.\n\nFirst, you can't assume that the stock certificate is worth anything at this point. You MUST contact the Stock Transfer Agent for Meredith. That is Equiniti:  800-468-9716. Any time a physical stock certificate is issued it is no longer listed on the records of a broker and instead is listed on the Transfer Agents records. So there is no need to contact a broker first.\n\nYou will need some info before calling Equiniti. First, see if you have any old statements kept with the certificate. These will list the account number at Equiniti. Also, whoever is the first name on the certificate, you will need their social security number as well. \n\nYou will need to explain to the Customer Service Rep (CSR) that your Grandparents are deceased and you found a stock certificate among the possessions that they left for you in their will. The CSR will ask you if you know your Grandparent's account number (from a statement) and if not, the social security number of the first name listed on the stock. Thankfully you've already done that legwork. Next they will ask you to pass a verification check. This will include tell them exactly how the account is registered (the names on the stock certificate), the mailing address (most likely the last address your Grandparents lived at) and the last 4 digits of the shareholder's social security number (if you haven't provided the ss# to locate the account). They will also ask for your name and a telephone number for you. All Transfer Agents should capture this information on every call. \n\nOnce you've passed the verification, you can ask the CSR if the certificate is still a valid certificate. They will ask you for the certificate number, which is usually in the upper left hand corner of the certificate. It may include letters and numbers. They will also ask how many shares and when it was issued. With those three pieces of information they can tell if the certificate was previously claimed as lost and replaced (no longer valid) or if it is a valid live certificate.\n\nThe CSR will most likely not be able to verify anything else for you over the phone because you cannot prove over the phone that you are the legal heir to the shares. You cannot sell the shares at this time, you cannot change the address, or anything else. We treat you as a third party, not the owner of the stock for security purposes. So they won't tell you the current balance or anything like that. Sorry.\n\nTo obtain a current statement and change the address the CSR will most likely advise you to submit a letter in writing along with a certified copy of the court appointment naming you as executor of your Grandparent's estate, dated within 60 days, asking to change the address to your's. Unfortunately, since you are a third party, everything must be done in writing. Again, it is our job to safeguard the owner's account and you cannot prove you are the owner over the phone.\n\nOnce you have a current statement and have the address changed, and if the certificate is valid, you have a couple options. 1. Take it to a brokerage firm. They can deposit the certificate into an account. You will most likely need to provide them with the same legal documents you provided Equiniti. 2. You can transfer the shares into an estate account (if there are multiple heirs) or an account in your name. I'm not familiar with Equiniti's transfer process but you will most likely need to fill out Transfer Forms, obtain a Medallion Stamp from a bank or brokerage firm, and possible provide another certified copy of the court appointment. You will also need to mail them the original stock certificate. My company recommends sending the certificate trackable mail and insured for 3% of the value of the stock as this is the cost to replace it if lost.\n\nOnce the shares are in your name, whether at the broker or transfer agent, they are yours to do with as you please. \n\nNow, I will say, there is a very good chance that the certificate was claimed as lost and replaced already. There is also a very good chance that the company had no contact from your Grandparents in over 3 years and sent the shares to your state's Unclaimed Property Office. This is called escheatment. \n\nI also wouldn't get too excited about stock splits that everyone else is hyping. When a stock splits the shares are either issued in a new certificate or held electronically at the Transfer Agent. So your Grandparents may have cashed those in a long time ago. I also wouldn't get excited about dividends. The fact that you didn't mention that you received any quarterly checks from the company at your Grandparent's address has me feeling the shares are escheated or already cashed.\n\nThis is pretty exciting though and it's worth the effort to chase them down. I wish my company was the Transfer Agent because then I could look it up in a few seconds and give you the good or bad news.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me, and fingers crossed you hit the jackpot!""]",,False,27,[1615740370.0]

Comment,m4inen,gquw6ae,t3_m4inen,patrick351,"['Hi OP, I actually do this for a living so I want to give you some steps to help you look into this. A lot of people are really excited for you, however what they don\'t know is that just because you have a paper stock certificate doesn\'t mean it\'s worth anything - it\'s possible the original holder thought they lost it, reported it as lost to their broker or the transfer agent and was able to still redeem the certificate. Yes, that can happen, just because a certificate is lost doesn\'t mean the original holder can\'t still get their shares. Until you have at least confirmed the certificate is valid, there\'s not any point in celebrating.\n\nYou have two options here - the first is you can redeem them with your broker, the second is to redeem them directly with the transfer agent. Usually a broker is going to charge you a fee, but the process is a lot easier. If there\'s someone you are already working with your best bet may be to go to them. The broker will provide instructions to you on what paperwork they need to get this done for you.\n\nThe ""manual"" way is to redeem it with the transfer agent. Here are some general instructions to set you on this path:\n\nIf you go to the Meredith Co Investor Relations website and scroll down, you will see the transfer agent listed as EQ Shareowner Services. I am not going to put a website or contact information in this message, because I think it\'s important you do this yourself. Call them & report the death of your grandfather, and speak with someone about whether certificate itself is still valid. If it is, you have completed the first part of this journey. EQ should provide some instructions to you on how you actually need to redeem the stock certificate, and the documents they require may depend on how the shares were held. If it\'s under your grandfather\'s sole name, it\'s possible that EQ may ask you to provide documents for the Estate of your grandfather. Are you the executor of the estate, or are you in contact with them? They may need to be the ones to work with EQ.\n\nOften times for situations like this, the transfer agent may ask that the executor either open up a new account directly with EQ in the name of the estate, or that the Executor provide a written letter of instruction to instruct that an account be opened up for a beneficiary. In both cases, the new account holders will have to complete new account paperwork. This new account will be established to receive the shares from the deceased individual, and will hold book-entry shares - basically electronic shares. Often times this happens because companies don\'t like liquidating things under deceased individuals SSN\'s - the IRS doesn\'t like seeing activity under social\'s that are assigned to deceased individuals, so any liquidation will most likely need to happen under the EIN of the Estate, or the SSN of a beneficiary.\n\nOnce the new account is established and all the paperwork provided, then you can work with EQ to liquidate under the new account or to transfer the shares if you don\'t wish to liquidate. EQ will be your best friend for every stage of this process.\n\nFinal bit of advice - if you end up sending the paper certificate to anyone overnight, please  insure it. You may not need to insure it for the full amount, as like I stated before lost certificates can  still be redeemed, however redeeming a lost certificate often requires you to pay 3-5% of the underlying value of the certificate. Def throw some insurance on any original packages you send through the mail.\n\nEdit : also make copies of anything you send out']",,False,45,[1615686427.0]

It was a relatively simple but lengthy process. The biggest hurdle will be proving ownership however. I imagine the stock certificate is in your grandfather's name and you need to prove that your are the inheritor and executor of his estate through the courts. If you are named the executor of the estate then you can begin the process of converting that stock certificate into actual shares in a brokerage account. This process is done via any brokerage like Charles Schwab, J.P. Morgan, etc. I used Vanguard because I already have an account with them. I had to open a new brokerage account owned by my father's estate and then get the shares added to the account. Once the shares were reflected in my dad's estate's brokerage account, I was able to sell them as an executor and the money went into my dad's estate's bank account which is owned and operated by my siblings and I as the inheritors of his estate.

I would suggest you actually get them in your name and just let the dividends roll in or reinvest the dividends.\n\nGiven the age of the shares you’ll also probably have to convert them to a more current form, class C01 to C04 for instance. Corporations consolidate and split securities all the time, and they typically roll into one another. \n\nThe hardest thing is going to be proving you should be the owner.

And if you ARE a lawyer, it’s generally unethical to give legal advice to someone who isn’t a client, which is why lawyers are always saying things like “I’m a lawyer, but not *your* lawyer”, and “nothing in this comment should understood as legal advice”. The lawyer-client relationship creates a number of legally-binding obligations. \n\n2.\tIt’s ok to give legal *information,* though. The distinction is, I can tell you where to find a lawyer, or the field of law a problem falls into. Anyone can. But the instant *should* or *ought to* enter the situation, you’re crossing a line. Even just “this sounds complicated, you should talk to a lawyer” is closer to the line than some lawyers will go. \n\n3.\tEven if neither of those restrictions applied, the law is incredibly fact-dependent.

But I just got a guy out of all charges in exactly that situation because it turns out the police violated his rights during arrest and most of that evidence had to be suppressed. You just can never say. \n\n4.\tThat sub by its very nature entirely ignores all of the above. Which tells you all you need to know about the quality of the “advice”.

Comment,m4inen,gqx7frp,t1_gqvlnla,Aspirin_Dispenser,"['Consider this:\n\nThe median household income in the United States is ~$60k. If you are saving 20% if your gross income, as is recommended, that would be $1,000/mo. Your essential expenses should be about $30k, so an appropriate emergency fund would be $15k, which will take you 15 months to create. Once that money is set aside, there is really no reason to keep adding to it, because it actually loses value over time as a result of inflation. That means that your $1,000/mo savings can go straight into your long-term investments. Let’s say that your investment horizon is 30 years and let’s assume a modest return of 10% annualized over those 30 years. In that span of time, you would have invested $360k in cash and it would be worth **$1.9 million**. That’s the effect of compound interest and the time value of money. All you would have to do to get these results is drop $1k a month into an S&P500 ETF and not touch it for 30 years. \n\nIf you started doing this straight out if college, you would be 52 and sitting on $1.9 million. Here what’s even better, if you restructured that $1.9 million portfolio to be income producing, which, done properly, should pay you about 3% in dividends and interest payments, then you would be able to pay yourself a $57,000 salary *on the dividends and interest alone*. That means that your $1.9 million can continue to sit there and grow, albeit at a slower rate. Once you factor in your social security benefits and the return from an employer matched 401k, then there  is really no reason that you couldn’t retire at age 52 and spend more years retired than you did working. If you chose not to retire that early and worked another 10 years and retired at age 62, you’d have $5.3 million and be able to pay yourself a $159k salary. \n\nTL;DR: you don’t have to be dead to be a millionaire.']",,False,2,[1615745678.0]

In every state of the union, sodomy was against the law — all homosexuals were criminals.\n\nSo the nadir of gay rights was when the eldest of the baby boomers were 6 years old.  \n\n> The Stonewall riots (also referred to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the gay (LGBT) community[note 1] in response to a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Patrons of the Stonewall, other Village lesbian and gay bars, and neighborhood street people fought back when the police became violent.

In fact, the DIV valuation still has not even recovered since the market correction in 2020, while the total stock index recovered in 7 months. **The total stock market fund out performs the DIV portfolio by more than double** (since 2014). Like I said though, it all depends on how close you are to retirement. A nice sized portfolio still will get a decent dividend and could be used as income.\n\n\nAdditionally, I think you're confusing the return of DIV dividends.

This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.

This is going to drive money out of the markets and yields much higher.  There\'s no way I can see the FED letting this lapse, I see an extension coming for it which should temporarily relieve some fear and might even drop the yield price.  But if they don\'t extend it, then I think that sends banks into a panic to come up with capitol.  The next couple weeks are looking to be pretty volatile, I\'m mostly cash at the moment and will probably start getting back in after the FED announces the policy change or extension.  I know some banks are calling to make the relief permanent but I don\'t see that happening either.

So, the 3rd quarter will have some premium pay/Covid-19 expenses while the 4th quarter will have a significantly smaller expense.\n\nOther trends in COST favor include possible membership price increase, falling gas prices (increase their gas sales margin), sales increases (1/2 of February goes in 3rd quarter) February up 15.2%, two upgrades last week following all the downward price adjustments after 2nd quarter earnings and the list goes on.\n\nFWIW - last year Costco sold more than $52 billion of merchandise under its own Kirkland Signature brand, up 7% from 2019. That is more revenue than Coca-Cola, more than twice as much as Colgate-Palmolive and about the same as Kraft Heinz, Kellogg and Campbell Soup combined.\n\nIf I get motivated, one day I\'ll post my ""pump"" notes.']",,False,1,[1615754775.0]

You should never get into a situation where you sell at the bottom of a crash, for any reason whatsoever. This includes considering not investing your parents money. It feels like you are already overwhelmed with investing your own money. Think about what it will do to your mental health if you fuck up your parents retirement. This should not be your burden to bear.\n\n2) Set up a DCA plan for an assets that fits your risk tolerance. If it is an ETF, individual stocks or anything else purely depends on your risk tolerance. \n\n3) Stop worrying. It's only money.

If they are they are probably not posting about their mistake. The reason stocks tanked so hard is because so many people sold. Most of the people giving you advice on reddit will be ones who didn\'t have much to lose during the Covid crash or got in after and call you an idiot. Good on you for admitting your mistake. I have a bit of remorse over what could have been in 2020 as well. \n\nI had almost my whole 401k in really conservative plays through 2019. I was locked in for a heavy pull back. Slept better having it there. I also had a lot of cash from a house sale and stayed out waiting for a big dip. \n\nAfter the new year started in 2020 I said screw it, timing the market is impossible. I moved everything back into aggressive plays and a lot into REITs. I had the cash in a money market account for 1.5% and left it for 12 months. Covid crash hit a month after I moved everything and I kept saying ""HOLD!"" DON\'T WATCH. I saw about 30 percent disappear and it made me sick. Once I saw the bottom come (you just knew it was the bottom) I moved everything in my 401k into a tech growth fund knowing it was the only logical play. It gained 38 percent and if I wouldn\'t have touched it at the bottom it would have stayed there. REITs didn\'t recover. \n\nMy cash (which was the same amount as my 401k) never moved through all of it. Granted I didn\'t lose it but I didn\'t gain much. I could have made a years salary on that and instead I\'m now trying to enter the market and it\'s the same frustration you have. \n\nYour situation is worse but I want you to know you\'re not alone. A lot of people got scared during the shutdown and the only people you see on reddit are those who were around for the gain. The others have zero interest discussing their mistake or the market in general. I could have held out in my fixed income funds for 2 more months and I would have missed the drop all together. I had already held them for 12 months. There are opportunities everyday to make money. Try to look forward and not back. \n\nI have been buying dips on stocks that haven\'t returned to their pre covid levels. I\'m trying to get into an index fund but they are at their all time highs. \n\nProfessionals are emotionless with your money so they see clearer. I talked to a couple financial advisors and I wasn\'t impressed. They basically say ""we have these great funds"" and we will take 1 percent to give you access. Meh. The only benefit is they won\'t sell if times get rough but I still don\'t sleep well knowing the stock market is tanking with so much exposure. It doesn\'t matter who has control of my money. \n\nDon\'t put it all in. Buy in 10 percent chunks. It could run for a solid 24 months before we see anything drastic happen or it could start pulling back heavily after the next inflation data exceeds expectations. Nobody knows. For future reference, moving money from one sector to another is a better move then moving to cash. \n\nOne day the bears will have their day. They were starting to during the recent pullback in tech. People were buying dips until they had no cash left and the dips kept coming. It rebounded but at some point it won\'t and they\'ll be left waiting for months. That sucks and if you\'ve ever experienced it you know how it sucks. Those that rode the downward trend week after week in 2008 for a year aren\'t around here for the most part. Yes stocks will recover but sometimes it takes a year or two (or more potentially). \n\nAnyway, best of luck to you. Try to let it go and look forward. What\'s done is done. FOMO is real.

They've moved sideways for years and they are likely to continue holding steady, especially with 5g expansion and HBO max supporting their revenues. 7% yield that won't make you rich, but also won't blow your portfolio up.\n\nI would put the rest into SPY since it has a 1.5% yield as well as a good chance of ending the year higher than it is now.\n\nNote this is not what I'm personally invested in, since I have a 25 year horizon (mostly in growth atm, though I do have 15% in mREIT's and 10% in value).""]",,False,1,[1615751027.0]

Some people recommend 1 and 3 weeks into the month, the theory being there are bumps due to paychecks on the 15th and last day, not sure myself on this.\n\n- put around a third into high dividend stocks or etfs.  Someone mentioned REITs, those are a good way to get some yield also.\n\n- put a third into total market/sp500 type etfs\n\n- put the rest into growth/tech stuff.

Transferring your account may require some fees, so either move all of it now, or stay with it until you finish your DCA. If you want to avoid commissions, you can use Questrade (for all ETFs) or Wealthsimple Trade (for all Canadian stocks), and they will also reimburse the transfer fees for you.\n5. For a 60/40 allocation, the easiest solution would be to hold an all-in-one ETF such as VBAL or XBAL. Check out [Canadian couch potato](https://canadiancouchpotato.com/).\n6. You may also want to take a look into robo-advisors. Wealthsimple Invest seems to be very popular with redditors. It's a bit more expensive than the ETFs above, but it's probably easier to DCA into with recurring deposits.

One is $100k (parents) and the other is $80k (you). \n\nIt's hard to say what you'd need to do for your parents because there's no other information such as if they have any income, assets, age and lifestyle. If you want to represent a 60/40 split you can easily do this with a total stock market and a total bond market fund. There's plenty of choices out there but to keep it simple I'd go with either VTWAX (total world) or VTSAX (total US) for equities and VBTLX for bonds.\n\nAs for your money, I'd be 100% equities in either of the funds mentioned. Not sure if your parents money is in separate accounts but if not you could use an ETF for stocks to keep your funds separated. (VTI or VT). I'd have dividends be reinvested. You could literally log out of your account and not look at it until you're ready to reduce equities exposure and still earn market returns which will beat most of us dabbling in individual stocks over the course of a few decades.\n\nEDIT: I would lump sum invest. Going with DCA will likely leave room for FUD to kick in and maybe you don't follow the plan. Plus lump sum has shown to have better returns than DCA.\n\nEDIT2: I'd highly recommend you read /r/bogleheads because you're going to get a lot of, shall I say suboptimal advice here given your situation.

Hopefully OP doesn't take feedback in this post too seriously.\n\nThere's different investing strategies for different people at different stages of their lives.

If we get another dip in March, you should put some in, but I wouldn’t put it all. \n\nThis is a real problem for anyone when you’ve got a huge chunk of money to invest all of the sudden and avoid losses because it’s harder to dollar cost average in and avoid a big drop. \nSo maybe put your toe in by buying a very small amount in March...like 1%. I would put it in dividend stocks as they need income. So buy a nice dividend yielder on a down day. Try something like t, Bti, ko. Those haven’t had a huge run up like amazon, so don’t feel too guilty you’ve lost out. Ko is still a little under because of closed events, so it could still see mild growth. T under 30...particularly in 28 range and you shouldn’t have too much volatility. You won’t have a lot of growth, but at their age they shouldn’t be in all in on equity growth stocks anyway. When you buy hit “do not reinvest dividends”. This way going forward you can give them dividend income without having to draw down and sell off equities. For etf yielders  you can look at fra, pty. But again, you want to dca into anything as these could have losses if fed raises rates. \n\nThen dollar cost average a small percent of parents into growth stocks. But near retirement and with such a small amount saved for retirement, you can’t gamble wildly at their age as they have no time to recoup losses. So dollar cost average in a small amount into “growth”. I don’t know if a company like amazon is growth anymore. It’s a very expensive stock in a fairly mature company that pays no dividend but it’s not going away either.  You can try buying “slices” like you can on a site like Schwab-$50 bucks a time. You might try something like pltr, but again...this is not a stable stock. Lots of volatility so gambling a whole nut in it likely to result in pain. Allocate a small percentage to growth and dca in. \n\nLook at the M1 money supply. The savings rate is higher than ever. A LOT of people are sitting on cash. The reserve banks are printing like mad. You’re not the only one in this situation. All you can do is try and avoid making another mistake and dumping it all in at once. Set some goal that you’re going to dollar cost average in a certain amount each month over the next 12 months unless we get a huge down day. Don’t be reactionary and let your past mistake push you to into the arms of another. A lot of people “wake up” in this situation at 50 or 60 and think “now is the time to save for retirement” and try to make up for it and go heavy into crazy pure plays. \n\nAs always, I’m not an advisor.

I most likely have deeper underlying issues, I didn\'t technically sell everything at March, just wanted to simplify the post but what I did had essentially the same effect.

I wanted to deploy the rest after a pull back or crash. Stopped paying attention to the market shortly after and didn\'t even realize the market pulled back in December of 2018. So 60k cash sat in a 0% brokerage for 2 years. Then came 2020. The sentiment on reddit was that the sky was falling so not only did i not go long, i decided to go short with a leveraged inverse ETF at about 15k at literally the bottom on March 23. Then sunk cost fallacy came in, i kept hoping the short would recover so did not go long. I kept thinking, how can markets recover to pre-covid levels when the pandemic was still raging. I had only sold the short recently at a 80% loss. \n2. I guess I just cant accept the fact that going back in now would be essentially locking in my losses. And this just dragged on and on till today. I keep telling myself, why buy in now when you didnt when everything was half off. All this bubble talk lately also led me to believe we are due for a correction. \n3. My parent\'s investments only sat in a mutual fund for years, they stopped contributting so it was only the initial lump sum amount. I had the bright idea to sell the mutual fund and buy back the equivalent ETF so we can save on the MER. I think the idea was good but the execution was terrible.

And supposedly Jack in the Box and Chili’s.\n\nI’m also planning on investing in weed stocks as the US is legalizing marijuana, I support this (although don’t personally smoke, as I take medication that would have dangerous reactions like serotonin syndrome) and think it’s safe to say that these companies will blow up, and a lot of these stocks are only like $0.30 a share right now. Also mushroom and psychedelic stocks (microdosing is already legal).\n\nIf I made all that money from GME I could afford to invest in the short-term AND long-term, AND live it up RIGHT NOW, but I can’t go back in time, so trying to find the next play.\n\nMy money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I’m not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.\n\nI’m 25, I don’t want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I’m an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)\n\nI just want my independence and security, and I want it now, and, at least to some extent, kind of need it before the year is over.....\n\nI just want to enjoy the game of Life. I don’t want kids, so that’s a responsibility I won’t have, but I would like to be with women (which is easier when not poor/broke)\n\nThat’s the best I can explain it.\n\nI got banned from WallStreetBets for 5 days for mentioning a stock that is only worth $1, as I didn’t bother to read the side rules. I can’t mention it by name, but it’s only $1 a share, and some people believe it might be the next short squeeze, so I’m wondering if I should buy 500-1,000 or more shares of that.']",,False,6,[1615744711.0]

None discussing the product lines LMND actually is in or its growth or what makes it unique.\n\nDon't think any of them talk about their personal experience using it either. Which is kind of a shame. Use the app to do your DD. I've had zero problems with it and it's given me the best rate on renters insurance compared to both major car insurace companies I've had bundled with renters. Friends I've referred have had similarly positive experiences. No issues filing a claim or getting paid out. But that's anecdotal and online reviews always bring out misgivings. That's normal.\n\nThe true sell here as an investor is that LMND requires no agents to do the work. No hiring. And so scaling internationally as LMND has and into new verticals (like renters and life insurance as LMND also has) is a cinch -- weird that none of the posts here even considered the expansion and its success in that already. In short, LMND is a data and AI play. (I also like ROOT for these reasons, though it's not been received as warmly by markets. The test drive bit is kind of gatekeeping and restrictive but it too is something unique and worthwhile in insurtech)  \n\nComparing LMND to Progressive or Allstate or what have you is not the point. These have been stale and have yet to do anything like what LMND has done. Really. Talk to someone who works in legacy insurance and you'll see why. They're very conservative companies deep down and averse to change. And that's a okay. But to think they'll beat out LMND is kind of a joke if you know anything about the legacy insurers. Yes, you can sign up online there, too. But again, thinking that that's all LMND is is a mistake, particularly when it comes to its value proposition in scaling and the back end.\n\nLMND has a unique set of products and a sort of distinct urban clientele that swears by the product, and it's growing and cross-selling customers at a very fast clip, has a management that knows how to scale, and has a certain hype to it, like it or not. \n\nI bought at 50, sold some at 160, will hold for the next decade. LMND also seems to attract a lot of shorts and bashers (look at stocktwits page), and I'm sure a true short report will be around the corner. This to me in the long run is kind of a good sign -- everything from SHOP to ENPH to TSLA has been similarly targeted.

There are EU alternatives as well to those ones. I would allocate 90% to ETF, and 10% to stock picking while learning. In the meantime learn how to evaluate a company, to read financial statements or at the very least the concepts of PE, PS, PB, PEG, cash flow etc. Once you get more skilled in picking stocks, I'd increase my single stock %.\n\nAlways keep something like 15% cash for good opportunities like last month. By studying and identifying the company you like you'll be ready when everyone panics to buy them at a discount, because you've done your homework before.\n\nAnd remember that 99% of traders don't beat the market.

That said I wouldn\'t recommend buying something just because ""people are talking about it"" that isn\'t a good strategy. If yo ain\'t 100% confident in your stock picks, you might also want to include some index funds. You could do something like 20% Total US market, 20 developed markets, ex US, 20% emerging market and 40% individual stocks. you can also do a 30/30/30/10 split and just follow two stocks closely, to really learn what it\'s like to invest in individual stocks.\n\n\\-Is it okay to discuss EU stocks  \nYes. We have a lot of people from the US here, and US stocks have done great in the past, so naturally, you get a lot of people thinking that US stocks are the only stocks that make sense to invest in, which is false. People also somehow got the idea that ""they know US stocks better"" something I can\'t exclude, but I highly doubt they know them better than any other stocks, at least to any meaningful extent. That said accounting regulation differs between countries, and you need to be aware of this if you invest in individual stocks around the world.\n\n\\-Are prices too high?  \nToo high? I don\' know, but prices are very high, which has a negative impact on future returns.  \nTo quote every financial article ever written. ""If things go well stocks might go up, but if things go poorly they might also go down""  \nIn any case, it\'s better to be invested than not. If you are very worried and are sitting on a lump sum, you can divide that sum by 12, and invest it over 12 months.\n\n\\-How did I get started.  \nYoutube inspired me at first.  \nI would start by watching the lectures Aswath Damodaran got on his channel. That should get you started with the basics. When you\'re done with that I can provide you with a reading list if you are interested.\n\n\\-Have you ever doubted your trades  \nYes I think that\'s true for everyone. Back in September when the market was setting all-time highs I was down 16% for the year. I was not happy. Today I am up 24% vs the markets 22% since 01/012020. every single person that invests in individual stocks will have periods of underperformance, in some cases, they will underperform massively.  \nFor me two things really help. The first is just knowing what you are doing. If you know the companies you are buying are solid, you know it\'s stupid to sell when they are down. In fact doing anything other than buying more would be stupid. After all, if the price is down 16%, but the fundamentals are the same, my return must be 16% higher now..  \nAnother trick I use is to only look at my portfolio when I buy and sell stocks. Not much is going to change in a company in a month, and the only time you get enough information to truly act is with the quarterly report, so unless you find a new company you want to invest in, you can\'t make a lot of meaningful changes outside of earnings season anyway, so just don\'t bother looking, or in the case of most people. Just fight the urge to look. It gets easier with time.\n\n\\-Any suggestions  \nI already suggested the 20/20/20/40 or the 30/30/30/10 split between indexes and individual stocks, and I stand by that.  \nNext time ask one question at a time. I\'m not even going to proofread this that\'s how long it is, so I\'m sorry about all the errors.']",,False,5,[1615713996.0]

Health insurance companies are just too integrated into our health care system for them to just disappear overnight and the likelihood that centrist politicians would sign off on a system that that eliminates them is slim to none.\n\nGiven demographic trends and the rate that the Democratic party has moved in a more progressive direction over the course of the last decade or so I would think the opportunity to pass a real universal healthcare bill will present itself in the next couple of decades, but that opportunity will come before an actual progressive majority takes hold of both the legislative and executive branches (assuming that even happens in the first place). Ultimately the choice will come down to getting it done faster with compromises with the center or waiting long enough to pass Medicare For All in its current form, and the left will most likely compromise on it to get it done faster as long as it gets the basic core objectives met.\n\nThere\'s going to be pushback from legislators in states that employ lots of people in the health insurance industry (which, by the way, is a figure in the low millions) because Medicare For All amounts to tons and tons of people losing their jobs. Which, yeah, redundancy drives a lot of the cost of our health care system and one of the things that makes Medicare For All a cheaper proposition than our current health care system is that it cuts a lot of that fat out of the system, but that still translates to job losses that politicians don\'t want to be blamed for. Not to mention industry lobbying would go balls to the wall to stop that from happening because their livelihoods would literally depend on it.\n\nI\'d put my money into the system we get looking a lot more like ""Medicare Advantage For All"" rather than ""Medicare For All"", mostly because it softens the damage on both those fronts and makes it an easier proposition to get done without the progressive majority needed to pass the pure Medicare For All bill. You still have health insurance companies that won\'t suddenly have to lay off all their workers, and ultimately for the majority of people that get their health care as part of their benefits from their employers would likely have a similar arrangement. The main difference would be that Medicare would be available to everyone, including the zero premium plans that I imagine would likely be popular among low income households.\n\nAgain, all of the specifics of this are speculation but the underlying idea behind all of it is that I\'d be hesitant to say that companies like this would necessarily be hurt if the US passed some kind of actual universal healthcare, to the point where I\'d still think companies like this will be around for a long time.']",,False,0,[1615742926.0]

Comment,m4i6p3,gqujdz2,t3_m4i6p3,BannerlordAdmirer,"[""I'm not too familiar with Hindenburg before the CLOV short report but Citron has been coasting off their (correct) thesis on Valeant for several years. I remember he was trying to target Shopify, Nvidia, and Tesla but was wrong. Then got fucked on GME.\n\nI think they split their things up into their legitimate convictions and then there's some backroom stuff going on where they target companies to give entry opportunities to, I guess other firms they have some affiliation with? Because a few months later they generally announce they close the short and announce they're out.\n\nThen why not remain short indefinitely and ride it to zero since their thesis often amounts to accusations of outright fraud? If they're concerned with short squeezes it seems like they had longer to ride it down before covering. It's not some skepticism but accusation of outright fraud: in other words an all-or-nothing proposition. With SPACs the last 3 short reports are very heavy with insinuation and scare language. The common investor probably does not have a good familiarity with what a DoJ inquiry or affiliated parties among customers means - so the authors will maximize the sinister quality of it.\n\nI'm seeing this with Triteras and with Phase2. I saw  a wave of funds file Form 13F on fintel which means that the institutions don't take the thesis seriously, because this was a month after the short presentation. Other longs researching this reached out directly to Phase2 asking for more info on the blockchain transactions to verify if the management's response was true and got angry reactions instead of providing it when it was in their best interest to do so. So waited to get in below $7, then boom Western Union partnership and it spikes to 8.00.\n\nAnd there's also a bunch of smaller no name hedge funds on Twitter usually hopping on the bandwagon, also claiming to immediately cover their shorts way too soon if they actually believed they were correct. So it's just a part of the overall Stocktwits and media message and sentiment game.\n\nSo they're not necessarily enemies, they create tons of opportunities. With the TRIT timeline I got the chance to see how the smart money responded (by going long en masse, which I could publicly see on fintel in late Feb, not a secret at all), read the rebuttals and debates, and then I could follow, all before the rip up comes. It felt strange to have such a big window for a regular retail investor to grasp the situation and get in, like a free info arbitrage trade.  I think it's a pretty weak effort to keep people out, but if you wait a few months after SPACs IPO for the attack, seems like a great opportunity to swoop in with a lot more information. Of course if you're already in BEFORE the short attack it will suck.\n\nHowever, with NKLA, Hindenburg was absolutely dead on. But the style of presentation is completely different. Brutally and fully destructive, scorched earth, every little sordid detail laid out (like the president of the battery company with the scam tech blowing the money on prostitutes lol). Meaning, they use all the ammunition and damning evidence they have: what does this imply when they don't? They resort to insinuation and 'hint hint' language when they lack it, which seems to be the case with CLOV. In the future I really think they're going to mix it up and make it less obvious, but right now they don't care since it's just a couple guys in specific communities that get to exploit them.\n\nBut SPAK did find a bottom recently, a few people called it correctly that I've been trading/investing with. The opinion I've seen is that we're going to look back at this time and won't be able to believe we got into all these companies at such cheap prices.\n\nWhether intentional or not, this is trying to condition the savvy investor to not take part in SPACs immediately and wait for the short reports. I think there is truth to Wall Street despising the SPAC process for getting retail investors into IPOs so much cheaper.\n\nWould love to see a compilation of all SPAC and short reports in the last say 5 years.

During the meteoric rise of TSLA (during November, I believe) before they became part of the S&P, Musk promised a vehicle he had previous denied even existing; in fact, he had spoken out against making the vehicle -- which resembled something more than an SUV but less than a truck. He had to promise the stars of only to get his stock price to the moon (#NoOneLeftBehind). This is what businessmen like to do and Musk is not even the 100th person to do it.\n\nGranted, one day...Lord knows when that might be...the Level 5 will be so commonplace and effective that this situation will be moot, but technology only gets better as we can generate the capacity for it and production of it.\n\nIf your friend feels cheated, so were we all when we were young and bought ""experimental"" doo-dads and whatnots because we were ""promised"" an expectation that inevitably fell short. Musk should be held accountable, as any manufacturer should be, but that fine print is tricky. The lawyers get ahold of products ling before the FDA, DOT, or any of their ilk do. There is some clause somewhere in the microscopic inking that says ""Buyer beware"" but no one can read 6 pt, even on a 4k res screen.\n\nBottom line, chalk it up to investing in better relics for the future that we\'ll scoff at in the year 2077 when were on Mars in Space-X/Amazon streaming taverns eating space wings at $5 a drumette.']",,False,4,[1615746072.0]

I generally sell week long calls on Friday's as the price is rising, usually pretty far OTM where I feel comfortable selling the stock if it does execute or expire ITM.  Then as the stock starts it's climb back down I might turn my perspective to selling puts.  I'll sell the puts at a price I don't mind buying the stock at if it does execute or expire ITM.  All in all your goal is to continue to hold the stock since your long on it, but to make premiums on the upswing and downswing.  The risk is you sell your stock (you still make money) or you acquire more on the puts (which you're long on the stock anyway so acquiring more shouldn't be a bad thing).\n\nOf course, it also depends on the rise.  If the stock sees a 100% return or something way beyond your price target, you might consider selling all together and rebuying once the  stock settles back down.  Just think when you got into that stock you planned to make a nice return in a longer time frame.  You just realized that return in days or weeks, that's also a win, move on and come back later if the value is there.

From the article: ""Democratic politicians raising concerns about how quickly coronavirus vaccines..."", this definitely is something that one should be concerned with, pushing a vaccine without enough  evidence will result in people rejecting vaccines. We should be thankful that FDA did it\'s due diligence and didn\'t succumb to pressure from a scientifically impaired individual like Trump, after his hydroxy..goof up.\n\nMy comment was about this: \n\n1/3rd Republicans wont commit to taking a vaccine. This is an issue, that will effect if and when we will reach herd immunity \n\nhttps://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/27/anti-vaccine-republican-mainstream-1344955\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-republican-hesitancy/\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/03/07/republicans-covid-vaccine/\n\nOn kids in cages:\n\nLol. You should read the Washington post article you posted, it is exactly the post I posted. If you read the post it would explain how Trump\'s policy is way more inhumane and was deliberate. Obama\'s efforts were a last ditch effort. Immigrants both legal and illegal had been hit hard under Trump. Increased racial attacks on Asian Americans for example']",,False,0,[1615765107.0]

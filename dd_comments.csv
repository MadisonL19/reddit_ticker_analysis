Comment,m27zg5,gqhpp92,t3_m27zg5,Trevonious,"['My explanation for why there was such a large dip:\n\nVolume was WAY too low to cause such a huge drop in price, so I asked in GME Megathread Part 1, ""How could that large of a dip happen, with such a low volume?"", also pointing out that IBorrowDesk didn\'t report any new shorts, during the time of the dip. I didn\'t realize that when shorts are borrowed, the borrower has 3 days to use them, or they have to be returned. Shorts HAVE been borrowed, in large numbers, over the past few days. That means that hedgies were borrowing shorted shares, iron handing them, borrowing more, and then they released them all at once (or in large chunks because of the halts). That allowed them to tank the price in a very direct and focused manner, say $160 in a matter of 20 minutes (and that includes the halt times). I believe this was an attempt to trigger stop losses and scare day-traders into selling. The immediate rebound and the fact that THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO AMC, AT THE SAME TIME, seems to corroborate this theory.\n\nThanks to /u/_Exordium\n, for explaining this rule for borrowing shorts!\n\n220@$125.61 average\n\nTLDR: Since there has been millions of shares shorted over the past few days, and they have 3 days to use the shorted shares, I think that the dip was caused by hedgies hoarding shorts to release all at once. Thus tanking the price and triggering stop losses and scaring day-traders into paperhanding. Also, exact same tactic used on AMC, at the exact same time.\n\nEdit: Thanks for my first rewards! I want to reiterate that this is my opinion and I am not an expert on ANY of this stuff. Some people have mentioned that shorts don\'t work that way and I would direct them to u/_Exordium s comment, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m27zg5/gme_megathread_part_iii/gqi61ai/). I did some searching on my own and did not find any sources that say borrowed shorts MUST be sold, immediately, so it seems like there is more evidence to the contrary (based on his links). I am not trying to confirm my own bias, with this comment. It very well could have been a big fat whale, doing big fat whale things.

The rise has been pretty steady, and you have to keep in mind that they borrowed an absolute shit ton of shares today. They don't have to immediately short their shares once they borrow them, so they can build up their supply in order to hit us with huge price drops when the price goes too high for their comfort.\n\nThe price was rising very rapidly today, up to around $350, and they decided to pull out all the stops and stifle what they could, but the massive amount of buy-ins on the dip put the price back above where we left off yesterday and up 8% from where today started. If you zoom the chart out, it looks like a staircase. Huge spike, light cooldown followed by sideways trading, then repeat.

It seemed like the only way to ensure they win and retail investors lose by making us the bag holders once they hit their break-even point and crash the stock. But, after today's blatant manipulation on a large stock with no news, it's clear that there is BIG money and it is DESPERATE. It's also clear that in today's desperation, there was an abject failure. The $350 gain was essentially wiped away, but all that does is delay us a day. If they had ammo to run the stock down, why not do it when it's trading at $50, when sentiment was low, when smart larger investors can't see how this thing just prints money?

With this massive dip they repositioned with an extremely high amount of calls (amount of calls purchased went up greatly during the crash). Now that they technically carry a much larger position with said calls, they will profit much greater. If there is a gamma squeeze on Thursday 3/11 and it surpasses $800/share, it would force a margin call on certain hedge funds. \n\nWith said margin calls, it would further increase the price now as smaller firms begin covering. With the price continuing to go up, it would create a chain of margin calls on hedge funds as they’re all forced to cover. This would leave many out of their positions and unable or unwilling to do anything on Friday. \n\nTL:DR; “friendly” institution forced price drop via share dump to reposition at a much bigger position with calls at the bottom. This forces a greater reaction when it comes to squeezing time 💎🙌🏻🚀🚀🚀\n\nedit: if this were to happen it would also open massive doors for GameStop. They could force a share recall on Sunday, going into effect Monday, and literally murder anyone with a short position.  \n\nedit2: if all calls up to $800 are ITM between 3/11-3/12 there’s the ability for the institutions holding said calls to exercise them and further force a price increase. If one institution owns a massive amount (let’s say 40k+ calls) and exercises them all at the same time, it’s game over.

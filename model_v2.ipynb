       " array([\"Theory: By selling covered calls on virtually any stock(in this case VXX) you can vastly outperform the market over both the long and short term.\\n\\nHow it started: While I was holding around 1600 CRSR shares and slowly watching them go down post-earnings call, I started looking into selling covered calls on my shares as a way to recoup losses and lower my average cost per share by buying more shares with the premiums. The idea was to sell the calls just above my buy-in price so that no matter what I would get to keep the premium and worst-case scenario if they were executed, I would still make a meager profit on the sales of the shares. After doing this a couple of times, I started to wonder what the potential downsides of this strategy are. The first one was obvious, since all the money was in one business, if something happened overnight and that business went bankrupt(EX: Enron) then you would lose everything because the shares would be worth nothing and you can't sell any more options. After this, I struggle to find another downside with this strategy.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*The Solution\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nIn order to eliminate the single stock risk, I started to look at ETFs. The one I settled on was VXX for a couple of reasons. The 1st reason is that VXX is currently at/near an all-time low. This helps lower the risk of the shares devaluing over time and becoming worthless. The 2nd is because while I know I am not smart enough to time the market, I am smart enough to know that at some point in the short to mid-term future the market will need to correct. VXX is the perfect insulation against this because as the market falls and volatility increases, VXX will increase in price. As an added bonus, since VXX is an index that tracks the volatility of the market it inherently has a higher volatility than other stocks and thus has higher option premiums.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*The Experiment\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nOn Tuesday, March 23rd I decided to pull the trigger and attempt my theory. I put around $54,000 inot VXX for a total of around 4,300 shares at an average of $12.05. After this, I sold 43 3/26 $12.50 options for $20 each for a total of $860 and reinvest into more VXX shares. The options expired worthless today and I kept the $860 and will do the same thing this Monday. If the options were to be worth $20 each and expire worthless every week and I \\\\*\\\\*DON'T\\\\*\\\\* reinvest anything into more shares over the course of a year then I would net $44,720 in additional money for a return of nearly 83%.\\n\\nNow, I am not naive enough to think that they will expire worthless every week, but in the event that they do get executed and have only gone slightly above the execution price, I can simply rebuy fewer shares and start the process over again. Should the ticker skyrocket overnight(entirely possible with VXX) then I will simply sit on my cash and wait for it to come back down to more normal levels.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*The Question\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nIMO, this scenario doesn't leave any possibility of me taking a long-term loss and a very slim possibility of a short-term realized loss. While I am not saying that I have cracked the code and found some genius way to make free money, I do think that the fact that there is SO much room between 83% returns \\\\*\\\\*WITH NO REINVESTMENT\\\\*\\\\* and the average 7% return of the market that it is highly likely that this theory would easily beat the market returns and likely be above a 20% return a year.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Please tell me what I have done wrong or not thought of.\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: I am now aware that VXX isn't the right stock to be doing this with long-term. Appreciate the insight and would like to know how you would feel about it if it was a different stock/etf that isn't predestined to continually go down in the future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Too much stuff to go through\\n\\nLet me end this by saying I may be missing something very obvious that completely ruins my theory and makes me look like an idiot, but so far I don't see a flaw with my theory which is why I am here to see if anyone can debunk it.\",\n",

It looks risky, for a trunk load of reasons. While EV prices will come down as production numbers increase, they might not come down a lot because the costs of the key materials that go into them – steel, nickel, copper, cobalt, lithium, among others – are all surging. EVs remain luxury products.\\n\\nFocus:\\n\\n> VW has evidently concluded that its all-EV strategy is less risky than it appears, but you would never get its executives to admit why.

The recent rotation was a rude awakening for me because it specifically impacted growth, tech, and renewables (the majority of my holdings).\\n\\nI have since taken on a cautiously aggressive strategy of picking individual stocks that pass five tests. I wanted to run my theory by this group to hear your thoughts. Note, I’m not trying to find deep value stocks or ten-baggers or anything – just solid doers that have a good chance of outperforming the market for many years to come.\\n\\n**Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?**\\n\\nThink of getting your driver’s license photo taken. When I most recently renewed my license, I had a huge beard, and now I’m stuck with that photo for most of my 30s. Of course you don’t need to hold a stock that long. But I think it’s a good framework for analyzing stocks, because they really should be longer term investments. Is this a company that will still be doing well in six years? Can I take myself seriously holding this for that long?\\n\\n**Test 2: What’s the P/E ratio?**\\n\\nNothing new here. But it’s usually the next thing I consider. 12 to 24 great. 25 to 34 understandable. 35-49 caution. 50+ or negative, too speculative.\\n\\n**Test 3: Did it already moon?**\\n\\nThis was an oversight with one of my original picks. The stock had been trading in the teens in 2019 and was around $100/share when I first bought it. Averaging down is no fun. If a stock mooned anytime in the last 5 years, you might have to accept you missed the ticket. Check 10, 20+ years back for older companies to gain more context.\\n\\n**Test 4: How linear is its growth?**\\n\\nIdeally I’d like to see a perfectly straight line over the past 5 years. Something that steadily marches upward over time with minimal volatility, and something that has gained between roughly 125-250% over the past 5 years. While I think lots of companies will do well as companies, I’m hesitant to invest in them if their history looks like a roller coaster. I especially take note of how a company did through 2018-2019, how it did before the Covid crash vs. after, and how it did these past couple months.\\n\\n**Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?**\\n\\nMaybe this goes without saying, but I think a company's profitability is a good indication of whether it will do well in the future. It’s nice to see the past 5 earning reports beat expectations, though 4 out of 5 isn’t bad either.\\n\\nOf course, it’s hard for any stock to pass all five tests, and if I was a purist I probably wouldn’t be very diversified. Some stocks that fit closely with these criteria include UNP, GOOGL, V, HD, DG, TMO, SPGI, and TXN. (This is not financial advice.) Can you think of any others?\",\n",

Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.\\n*****\\n> “It’s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Obviously, we’ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They’re trying to figure it out.”\\n*****\\n> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.\\n*****\\n> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.\\n*****\\n> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.\\n*****\\n> “It’s in the driver’s seat right now,” said NatWest’s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.\\n*****\\n> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.\\n*****\\n> “If anything, we’re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,” he said.\\n*****\\n> # Infrastructure plan\\n> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.\\n*****\\n> “The Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don’t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,” he said. “If all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I’m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.”\\n*****\\n> Gwinn said the market has “fiscal fatigue.”\\n*****\\n> “There’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it’s going to be passed, when it’s going to be passed and whether it’s going to be passed ... It’s not tangible enough,” he said.\\n*****\\n> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.\\n*****\\n> # Rotation\\n> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.\\n*****\\n> “I think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.\\n*****\\n> “It’s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,” he said. “I think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that’s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.”\\n*****\\n> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.\\n*****\\n> “As we’re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,” he said. “To their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy — energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they’re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.\\n*****\\n\\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vO6bgbd.png))**\\n\\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/DHyy0jK.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/r9toVhW.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/WsvEjsM.png))**\\n\\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Yifrz8S.png))**\\n\\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ciosFuJ.png))**\\n\\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mlnREkj.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CtwxDvI.png))**\\n\\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DIpCmjL.png))**\\n\\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/a57hPvk.png))**\\n\\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/up2SDlt.png))**\\n\\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/16Psc5m.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TSJJQus.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/pLkbs1k.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month – Up 15 in a Row\\n\\n> April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.\\n\\n> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).\\n\\n> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.\\n\\n> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that “work-from-home” stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.\\n\\n> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April’s performance since 1953. April is DJIA’s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.\\n\\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9044f7ae02c5c0f0137bff0911ef7cb6/1367b75d549eb11f-fe/s400x600/d969c7c83e5a15cfb4c671e0a9ca959aa6c9fc54.jpg))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # Historic Year for the S&P 500\\n\\n> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.\\n\\n> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).\\n\\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**\\n\\n> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.\\n\\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-Sector-table.png))**\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities\\n\\n> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.\\n\\n> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:\\n\\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\\n\\n> “After likely their worst period in history, although I wasn’t around for the bubonic plague so I can’t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn’t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.”\\n\\n> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market’s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the “stay at home environment” benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December—even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.\\n\\n> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?\\n\\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**\\n\\n> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low – actually it’s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.\\n\\n> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn’t bad either.\\n\\n> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals – and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA “Sell in May”).\\n\\n> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let’s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means “bearish” perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 26th, 2021** \\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\\n\\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.28.21**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/a57hPvk.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/7ZBW7kO.png))**\\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!]())**\\n(N/A.)\\n\\n*****\\n\\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # ***Monday 3.29.21 Before Market Open:***\\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KCFoZ0p.png))\\n\\n> # ***Monday 3.29.21 After Market Close:*** \\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/A79uQcQ.png))\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # ***Tuesday  3.30.21 Before Market Open:***\\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JTM92oZ.png))\\n\\n> # ***Tuesday 3.30.21 After Market Close:*** \\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CO3uIVi.png))\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # ***Wednesday 3.31.21 Before Market Open:*** \\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/T13r2c7.png))\\n\\n> # ***Wednesday 3.31.21 After Market Close:*** \\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4o0Mk0k.png))\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # ***Thursday 4.1.21 Before Market Open:*** \\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EE7bg7B.png))\\n\\n> # ***Thursday 4.1.21 After Market Close:*** \\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWonNMB.png))\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # ***Friday 4.2.21 Before Market Open:*** \\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\\n(NONE.)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # ***Friday 4.2.21 After Market Close:***\\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\\n(NONE.)\\n\\n*****\\n\\n> # BlackBerry Limited $9.63\\n**BlackBerry Limited (BB)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 5:05 PM ET on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.

       " array([' \\n\\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**\\n\\nStocks gained on Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.\\n\\nFor February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge – rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank\\'s 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months “is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done \"gradually over time, and with great transparency.\"\\n\\nThe 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \\\\[sectors\\\\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.\\n\\nDespite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today\\'s dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \\n\\n**Highlights** \\n\\n* U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. \\n* Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan\\n* WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019. Japanese bank Softbank remains the company’s largest backer.\\n* NIO became the latest carmaker to temporarily suspend production on Friday as a result of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has led to major problems for car manufacturers across the world.\\n* The Federal Reserve said that temporary restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most banks on June 30 -- subject to how the banks fare during the annual stress tests. Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.\\n* **\\\\*\\\\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning, premarket, and does not reflect intraday changes\\\\*\\\\***\\n* Alliance Data Systems (ADS) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $105 to $150 at Overweight.

It started with just over $11 million in capital from 258 people in his circle of friends in Tarrant County, Texas.\\n\\nFounder and CEO, Jeffrey Harp, was previously CEO of Summit Bancshares, where he spent 16 years. Summit was a 138-year-old bank that was acquired by Frost in 2006. When Summit was acquired, it had over $900 million in deposits. Much like Frost and Trinity, albeit to a lesser extent, Summit also made most of its loans to businesses (both C&I and owner-occupied CRE) and had a cheap source of funding – given that most deposits were non-interest-bearing demand deposits from banks. Whether we are talking about the loan book, the securities book, earning asset’s duration, the source of deposits or leverage, the three banks are similar.  \\n\\n(...)\\n\\nI would say that the main difference between Frost and Trinity in terms of culture and business model, is that Trinity has a much sharper focus on keeping costs low. Assets per employee at Trinity are $13 million versus $7 million at Frost and $6 million at similarly sized (compared to Trinity) banks. The fact that Trinity does a lot with little is achieved by basically leveraging their fixed costs at their only branch. Much like a hedge fund, the contribution margin of increasing assets becomes bigger and bigger, until more branches, etc. are needed. Trinity opened in May of 2003 with 13 employees. They managed to work with 13 employees until the balance sheet grew to $215 million in deposits. In practical terms, this translates into non-interest expense (rent, salaries, etc.) as percentage of average assets of 1.5% versus 2.7% for peer banks and 2.3% for banks with $1-3bn in assets. Curiously, net non-interest expense is 1.3% at Trinity versus 2.2% at peer banks and 1.4% at larger banks (which typically charge more fees).',\n",

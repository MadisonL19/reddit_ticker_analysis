Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210326theendofthequartercouldcreatevolatilityformarketsintheweekaheadhtml Stocks could be buffeted by endofquarter trading in the week ahead as pension funds and other big investors buy bonds and sell stocks to rebalance their portfolios The dramatic move higher in bond yields this quarter sets up fund managers to shift their holdings to make up for the shortfall in bond holdings The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy with the March employment report expected Friday and the White Houses infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday but bonds will trade half a day ending at noon Economists expect 630000 jobs were added in March and the unemployment rate fell to 6 from 62 according to Dow Jones President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his 3 trillion to 4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form Stocks were higher in the past week while Treasury yields were less volatile The closely watched 10year was at 167 Friday down from 175 in the prior week Yields move opposite price and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings Its the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that said Peter Boockvar chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group Obviously well be keeping an eye on bonds The 10year now seems to be in a range of 160 to 170 I think people are just trying to find their footing here Theyre trying to figure it out Some strategists say the quarterend trade could end up being positive for stocks especially big cap tech since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily Stocks are higher for the quarter so far The SP 500 was up 16 for the week and up 58 for the quarter to date The Dow was up 14 for the week and has an 8 gain for the first quarter so far The Nasdaq has been the laggard falling 06 for the week and up 19 for the quarter Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10year yield rising from 093 at the end of last year Its in the drivers seat right now said NatWests Blake Gwinn of the 10year yield The 10year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates Gwinn head of US rates strategy said he changed his view on the 10year and he now expects the yield to reach 2 by yearend from 175 But in the near term he said the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their yearend which is Wednesday If anything were really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again he said  Infrastructure plan Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market The 19 trillion fiscal plan just signed by the president was one driver of bond yields as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring The Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now I dont have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my  forecast he said If all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that and that starts coming together in Q2 Im going to have to reconsider my 2 target Gwinn said the market has fiscal fatigue Theres a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how its going to be passed when its going to be passed and whether its going to be passed  Its not tangible enough he said The plan is expected to span multiple years and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it  Rotation The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter For the first quarter so far energy and financials were the best performers up about 33 and 165 respectively Tech was up 17 but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples I think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks said Dan Suzuki deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week Its not going to match one for one with every wiggle he said I think the basis behind it is real If you think rates are going to get up to 2 by the end of the year thats really bad for expensive highgrowth names The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction The higher rates go the worse it is for high multiple stocks Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the

Index bottomed on March 23 2020 and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class commodities As global activity quickly ground to a halt commodity prices plummeted with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history Since March 23 2020 commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID19 As shown in the LPL Chart of the day oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows while copper prices have pulled back a bit

around for the bubonic plague so I cant be certain commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick The US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output so as the rest of the world plays catch up we wouldnt be surprised to see commodities rise even further The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring to a more reflationary environment in recent months and this has pulled commodity prices along with it The commodity markets top performer lumber has seen a particular boom in prices as the stay at home environment benefitted the housing market leading to alltime highs in

from the March 23 2020 low  actually its 7478 It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market but that does not mean pun intended that we should expect gains like these moving forward We ran the numbers on the 1year rolling returns for the SP 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1year return since 1949 is 915 which isnt bad either With lingering pandemicvaccine and political and geopolitical

preferred inflation gauge  rose just 15 coming in well below the central banks 2 target The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy soonerthanexpected Moreover the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely Charles Evans President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank Yesterday in an interview with NPR Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2 average inflation over time and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done gradually over time and with great transparencyThe 10year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 168 at the time of writing The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up Gabriela Santos JP Morgan global strategist said We think longterm bond yields are just in a pit stop here in whats going to be a multiyear move higher Ultimately we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical sectors and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve We agree after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year its time for cyclical and reopening stocks many that remain well below prepandemic levels to recover as the economy gradually reopensDespite a volatile year so far the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the SP 500 extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021 underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy Rising Treasury yields hurt highgrowth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road Future cash decreases in todays dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now Highlights  US crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4 on Thursday as additional virusrelated lockdowns in

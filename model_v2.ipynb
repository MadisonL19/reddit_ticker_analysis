where once a  product or service is sold it is recorded as revenues For firms that  sell products or services over many years eg subscriptions it becomes  trickierUnder ASC 606 new revenue recognition standard The  new models core principle for revenue recognition is to depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services Thus  for a real estate developer working on a multiyear construction  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized  SUMMARY For most firms when a product or service is sold it is  recorded as revenues For firms that deal with long term contracts  memberships subscriptions etc revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration  eg 120000 for 1 year of service  10000month

documents vertical and horizontal analysisVertical AnalysisNo images allowed on the sub so heres a link httpsimgurcomtsbdF73httpsimgurcomtsbdF73This  method of analysis as the name suggests is top  down You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentageThis type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries and between companies because you can  see relative  proportions It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improvingVertical analysis isnt  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked  such as Where did costs rise or fall What line items are contributing most to profit margins How are they affected over timeEg  here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by sideHorizontal AnalysisNo images allowed on the sub so heres a link httpsimgurcomZkgy21yhttpsimgurcomZkgy21yThis method of analysis focuses on yearoveryear YoY or quarteroverquarter QoQ performanceHorizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles GAAP It improves the review  of a  companys consistency over time as well as its growth compared to   competitorsBecause of this  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts By  conducting a horizontal analysis you can tell whats been  driving an  organizations financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns line item by line item Ultimately  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over timecomparisons  from Q1 to  Q2 for exampleinstead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to othersTo perform horizontal analysis you1 Take the value of Period N2 Divide it by the value of Period N13 Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage changeEg  Revenue in 2017 was 4000 and in 2016 it was 3000 The YoY change in revenue is 40003000  1

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st 2021 A big jobs report looms in the week ahead as markets enter the oftenweak month of June  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210528jobsreportloomsintheweekaheadasmarketsentertheoftenweakmonthofjunehtml Mays employment report is the big event in the week ahead as stocks enter the often weak month of June Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance Big cap indexes like the SP 500 and Dow notched gains The SP rose a half percent and the Dow rose 19 The small cap Russell 2000 was flat up 01 and the techheavy Nasdaq declined 15 June is not historically a strong month for stocks Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years the Dow has gained just 012 in June and has been positive 52 of the time But over the past 20 years June was far weaker gaining only 40 of the time Junes performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year with an average Dow decline of 07 according to Bespoke The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity but the most important measure will be Fridays jobs report According to Dow Jones economists expect Fridays employment report to show the creation of about 674000 jobs in May after the disappointing 266000 jobs added in April That was about a quarter of what economists had expected You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations the market is going to get nervous said George Goncalves head of US macro strategy at MUFG Hopefully we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz and we go into the Fed meeting and then were Hey the economy is still on track  Big June event The Fed meets June 1516 and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary since the data is being compared with a weak period last year Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes not expected until at least 2023 If inflation runs too hot the Feds main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity In theory higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higheryielding bond investments over stocks The next big read for the economy is Fridays jobs report and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday It showed core inflation running at 31 year over year the strongest reading for that measure since 1992 The Feds beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday and ISM services is released Thursday Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday  Inflation flareup The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2 target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level Inflation has been running mostly below 2 prior to the latest numbers With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks hotter than expected the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory said Julian Emanuel head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors One of those stocks AMC closed off 15 on Friday after rallying 116 in the past week giving it a 2021 gain of 1200 The net net on the index level is basically its a stock market thats moving sideways Emanuel said Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run When you look at it in the medium term the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Feds paying insufficient attention to price stability Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Feds 2 target The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2 going back to 1989 is a decline of 16 with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform he said Technology stocks as measured by the SP information technology sector gained 16 in the past month and are up 59 year to date The sector is lagging the SP 500s 12 gain The topperforming sectors have been cyclical year to date with energy up 362 financials up 285 materials up 201 and industrials up 183 Communications services which contains some internet growth names gained 16 since the start of the year Health care has been outperforming information technology up 86 year to date In the past week the SP 500 gained 12 to 4204 and is within 1 of its alltime high The Dow rose 09 to 34529 and the Nasdaq was up 2 at 13748  Red flagOn the edges of the financial markets market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system In the past week institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday Theres way too much liquidity in the system and its happening as a result of the Feds ongoing QE but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus said Goncalves He said the funds from trillions in stimulus including to state and local governments have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system At the same time institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds now holding about 46 trillion Those funds also put pressure on the system since they put funds in Treasury bills Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse Theres no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system he said Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they dont have enough bills or shortterm commercial paper Theres not enough fixed income assets to go around said Goncalves He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio and they would prefer to find other higheryielding investments What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected he said This past week saw the following moves in the SP CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL SP TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEKhttpsiimgurcomKD7MPQqpng SP Sectors for this past week CLICK HERE FOR THE SP

economic data is either beating or missing economists forecasts it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas Driven by some improving COVID19 trends the economic backdrop has improved overseas while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the US This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many nonUS equity markets and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed nonUS stocks We believe the improving COVID19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread For several years now being underweight European equities relative to the US has been a winning trade A seachange in that thinking could be approaching as valueheavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value but a firm constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index or CESI tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts As shown in the LPL Chart of the day economically global conditions remain rather strong as evidenced by these indices which remain above the zero line This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions The repair of global trade activity as supply lines are reconnected has been notably key in nonUS data outcomes  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi2wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads202105blogchart52721pngssl1 Looking ahead we expect now elevated economic expectations particularly in the US may prove a tougher target As a result economic surprises both in the US and abroad may fade as we move through the year However the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021 Global real GDP contracted 33 in 2020 and it is expected to rise to 60 in 2021 according to Bloombergs consensus estimate before ticking down to 34 in 2022 Although high US economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021 we still believe US stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas it is tough to overlook US companies innovation and profitability advantages explained LPL Financial

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 10th 2021 Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210507inflationisthebigchallengeformarketsandthefedintheweekaheadhtml After Aprils disappointing jobs report market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead The tugofwar over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market after Fridays bounce more than halved the weeks losses in the SP technology sector The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266000 jobs created well below the 1 million expected The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its socalled quantitative easing bond purchases later this year The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like For now the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted oneoff report Its all about the inflation numbers Its all about the transitory nature and to what extent well see it said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group Its more relevant to the CPI monthovermonth changes If the monthovermonth gains are starting to pick up steam and were seeing 03 to 04 thats not transitory and thats a problem for the Fed Economists expect April CPI to rise 02 over March after a gain of 06 the month earlier But on a yearoveryear basis CPI is expected to look sizzling jumping 36 according to Dow Jones That compares to 26 the month earlier Excluding food and fuel CPI is expected to rise by 03 on a monthovermonth basis The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks a halfhour after the CPI print Wednesday Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan The producer price index is reported Thursday and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases Another important data point retail sales is released Friday Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by onetime stimulus checks Its like the steroid era of baseball he said Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus  Tech battleground The SP 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains The SP rose 12 to 4232 and 27 to 34777 But the technologyladen Nasdaq fell about 15 to 13752 even with Fridays 09 gain In the commodities market fears of inflation continued to build Copper futures hit a record high as did lumber futures rising 13 in the past week Corn futures rose 86 in the past week finishing at the highest level since 2013 West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2 to 6490 per barrel The 10year note yield which moves opposite price was at 155 down from 163 a week ago Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week with the SP energy sector by far the best performer up 89 Materials rose 59 followed by financials which were up 42 Industrials gained 34 But the SP technology sector slumped 05 for the week even with a 08 gain Friday I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling weve seen in the last few daysis not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names said Julian Emanuel chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG But its also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up thats where the capital gains lie he added So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 396 for taxpayers making more than 1 million Thats up from the current top rate of 20 Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill Emanuel said I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates The market is telling you that he said If you get a further move in rates thats a headwind Earnings season

ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces After struggling for most of the past couple months momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 125 compared to a 078 gain in the SP 500 The ARK Innovation ETF ARKK has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year After a 3839 gain from the March 2020 low to its high in midFebruary ARKK has fallen around 30 in the months since then For most of that time the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200DMA After a failed attempt to break above its 50DMA at the end of April it has taken a leg lower falling below its 200DMA for the first time in a year in the process While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200DMA it has found support around 105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall In other words from a technical perspective ARKK as well as some of its holdings still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months downtrends At least for the time being the group has found some respite in the move higher today  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050721ARKKpng As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately threequarters of net asset value For the most part these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year or since their market debut for those that have IPOed in the past year bolded and bordered rows in the table below with only a small handful in the red Teladoc TDOC Coinbase COIN and Iovance Biotherapeutics IOVA Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117 over the past year they have certainly been a pain trade recently Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment and relative to their 52week highs they are down 35 on average In fact of all 58 holdings there are only fourIntercontinental Exchange ICE TuSimple TSP Trimble TRMB and PACCAR PCARthat are less than 10 below their 52week highs and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings as such they are not pictured below  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050721ARKKTablepng While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP and EXACT Sciences EXAS have fallen below the longterm 200DMA Other names in the ETF broke below their 200DMA a while ago now and their charts do not look much better Stocks like Invitae NVTA Materialise MTLS and Teladoc TDOC collapsed below their longterm moving averages earlier this spring and this weeks moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels For TDOC and MTLS those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron REGN Unlike many other ARKK stocks REGN has actually been trending higher since March albeit that is in the context of a much longerterm downtrend than many other ARKK holdings Regardless that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its longterm downtrend In another move that is out of sync with its peers today it has reversed lower failing to break out from that downtrend  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050721ARKKBelow1png While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts Similar to the ETFs chart there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days For example DocuSign DOCU Iovance Biotherapeutics IOVA Palantir PLTR and Spotify SPOT are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year For others like Fate Therapeutics FATE Iridium IRDM PagerDuty PD PACCAR PCAR and Synopsis SNPS those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50DMA today Similarly Novartis NVS is attempting to move back above its 200DMA Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd SEE Over the past year the 50DMA has consistently provided reliable support After a brief dip back below in March in April it moved back above its 50DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week In order to keep track of the ARK Innovation ETFs ARKK holdings we created a custom portfolio that members can add here Please note that this does not update real time and is only based on ARKKs holdings as of 5621 As always investors should do their own research before buying or selling any securities and

talk of inflation continues to heat up one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex In our oneyear review of the market low we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery Well that trend hasnt stopped yet and as shown in the chart below on Wednesday the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads202105Blog5721apngssl1 Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE the Federal Reserves preferred measure of inflation remains to be seen but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019 while copper prices are less than 3 from their 2011 alltime highs However those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken In fact of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period To be clear we are not calling for runaway inflation In fact breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period However we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldnt be surprised to see this trend continue albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures but any persistent impact is likely to be modest Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday as we examine the April CPI data release  April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations Investors betting on a continued acceleration in US payrolls in April following Marchs impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be monthtomonth The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning revealing that the domestic economy added only 266000 jobs in April well below Bloombergsurveyed economists median forecast for a gain of 1000000 The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78000 jobs The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 61 from 6 though that was paired with an aboveestimate gain in the labor force participation rate which moved from 615 to 617 equaling a recovery high Average hourly earnings rose 07 month over month signaling lowerwage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way There are a few explanations for why this might be Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work Additionally stillclosed schools and lack of childcare may make it difficult for workers to return to the inperson segments of the labor markets And finally Marchs big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships such as furloughed employees Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous and timeconsuming vetting process As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low Total payrolls still sit about 82 million below the February 2020 peak of 1525 million but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lions share of those losses quickly despite todays disappointing readout  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021055721BlogCHartpngssl1 The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick While we always caution against reading too far into one data release we think most of the cited factors that suppressed Aprils payroll number should wear off naturally with time We believe that despite Aprils speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months Improving employment trendsthough choppybuoy consumer strength and the economy overall given consumers large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product GDP As such we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends where appropriate including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn  Lets Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes Our new Constitution is now established everything seems to promise it will be durable but in this world nothing is certain except death and taxes Benjamin Franklin First off we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market Weve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthythough probably not until 2022 It is worth noting though that stocks havent been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR With proposals for the 18 trillion American Families Plan AFP and 2 trillion plus infrastructure bill known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending Lets be clear though with a 5050 Senate Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties and historically slim Democratic majority in the House we think these final numbers will likely come in less than 3 trillion combined as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 396 from 37 and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than 1 million to a maximum of 434 from the current 238 Fun stat only 032 of the population makes more than 1 million a year so the truth is this wont impact the other 9968 of the population Weve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldnt be a surprise to anyone at this point explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick Now heres the catch looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy stocks did just fine Given the strong economic outlook this year youd have to think history could repeat once again As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day in 1986 and 2013 capital gains taxes increased but the economy was on firm footing back then compared with the 1970s hikes which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth Not surprisingly the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance while the 1970s hikes didnt Is it as simple as how the economy is doing It very well could be  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi2wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021055521BlogChart1pngssl1 Corporate taxes are currently 21 and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28 Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25 the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming which could knock a few percentage points off of future SP 500 Index earnings growth So what happens after corporate taxes are raised As the table below shows muted returns a year out are normal but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase suggesting investors werent very worried about higher taxes on the horizon  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021055521BlogChart2pngssl1 Its always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year theres not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome The picture is murkier though with corporate taxes which isnt surprising since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth But is often happens markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces  Individuals Writers and Managers All Still Bullish The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1 The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3 Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 17 percentage points to 443 While not a particularly large increase this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIIBullpng With bullish sentiment higher fewer respondents reported as bearish Only 231 of investors reported pessimistic sentiment down 26 percentage points versus last weeks reading Just like bullish sentiment that was not a particularly large change and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks range  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIIBearpng The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bullbear spread climbing 43 points to 212 While that is still at the high end of the past few years range it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers the bullbear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago In other words sentiment has moderated recently but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIIBullBearpng Perhaps the most notable reading in this weeks AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment Up 07 percentage points from the prior week it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 52 percentage point gains the previous two weeks Regardless moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March Other than that week and the current one there has only been one other week in the past year second to last week of 2020 in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now Even though this weeks reading is elevated relative to the past year compared to the rest of the history of the survey it is pretty unremarkable On average over the life of the survey neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 09 percentage points lower than this weeks reading  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIINeutralpng The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average 100 would be fully invested 0 would be market neutral 100 would be fully short and 200 would be leveraged short Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since midFebruary which also ranked in the top 2 of all readings going back to 2006 This week it fell 1593 points That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March but at 8779 the index

weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have temperedNew economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April compared to March even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US The Conference Board a nonprofit research organization released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 1172 in May from 1175 in April However on the positive side Aprils reading was the highest since February 2020 before the start of Covid19 lockdowns Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 1195 Yesterday members of the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program In separate comments Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation Richard Clarida Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve also said there will come a time in upcoming meetings when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that it is going to depend on the flow of data The Fed is currently buying 120 billion a month in governmentissued and governmentbacked securities and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recoveredThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will as they have said time and again wait for concrete data before any considerations are made This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14 which proves market participants shouldnt worry about quantitative easing tapering in my opinion Powell said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order

       " array(['PsychoMarket Recap  Wednesday May 19 2021The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses For example the Nasdaq QQQ opened 173 down but managed to close the day 012 up Despite the market declining modestly the last three days it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks As said before I thought the initial selloff after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this weeks price action  Leadership in equity markets has seesawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pickup in activity may generate a surge in inflation After leading the market higher in April in the last month the Nasdaq is down 477 compared to 079 down in the SP 500 In my view this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes basically a written record of what happened in the meeting which said that participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committees maximumemployment and pricestability goals and reiterated for like the millionth time that they did not believe a nearterm adjustment of monetary policy was needed Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down Read the entire meeting minutes herehttpswwwfederalreservegovmonetarypolicyfilesfomcminutes20210428pdfHowever it is important to note the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report which came in much weaker than expected which bolsters the Feds argument that employment remains far from their goal and the Consumer Price Index which showed a greaterthanexpected increase in consumer prices That said the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Feds view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be transitory and want to see a string of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are consideredAs the US economy reopens we are seeing a surge in consumer spending we saw a 108 increase in spending in March supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up inflation is expected to slow down In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitory In an April 28 meeting Jerome Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Moreover it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not Finally the April Job Report which showed the economy gained only 266000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy Highlights After declining in recent weeks the selloff in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified with Bitcoin BTC falling below 40000 after the People Bank of China PBOC doubled down on its stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldnt be used for transactions The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because theyre not real currencies Its important to note the statement doesnt have any new regulatory steps according to Yu Lingqu a vice director at the China Development Institute thinktank in Shenzhen  Ford Motor F is expected to unveil an allelectric version of its bestselling F150 pickup truck tonight The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown  Nvidia NVDA is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080 RTX

they buy like crazy and drive the price upIf you want to read more fundamental analysis on TAP read this awesome due diligencehttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslvb868molsoncoorsbeveragecotapddreopeningplayutmsourceshareutmmediumiosapputmnameiossmf over on WallStreetBets from uundream22Background of the TradeMolson Coors is an old company They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer eg Coors Light Miller Lite  Miller High Life For the last 45 years their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beersTruly  White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly FYI  hard seltzers are way more profitable than beerThe company got a new CEO who implemented a Revitalization Plan and is heavily investing in more profitable above premium beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network The important beverages include but are not limited to the following Topo Chico Hard Seltzer Zoa  Dwayne the Rock Johnstons energy drink Vizzy Hard SeltzerThesis of the TradeMolson Coors has three huge winners on its hands and Wall Street has no idea Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico Vizzy  Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the priceWhy Doesnt Wall Street Know YetWhile the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages they simply dont realize how big of a deal these drinks are They dont know this because 1 the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it and 2 Wall Street doesnt pay attention to store checks Google Trends or the power of social mediaLet me explain Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29 2021 This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets Two days later Molson Coors Q1 ended  So Wall Street doesnt have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call April 29th In the Q1 call the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico However based on the Dumb Money community channel checks Check our our Discord group stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy Topo Chico is selling as good if not better than Truly and White Claw This is a huge deal Moreover Google Trends show people are searching topo chico hard seltzer more than truly hard seltzer and more than white claw hard seltzer That is amazing And it was only released in NINE markets It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country Finally TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram Dont underestimate the power of social media Zoa was released on February 24th 23s into Q1 Aannnddd its release was initially limited to online sales and select instore sales Any numbers from Zoa were deminimis in Q1 results They are expanding their distribution and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 152 million on Twitter Google Trends show people are searching zoa energy drink just as much as monster energy drink and more than red bull energy drink Think about that for a second A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market Again Dont underestimate the power of the Rock on social media Last quarter Molson Coors had two unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings 1 The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth Texas for several days  impacting earnings 2 They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further Readlisten to the last earnings call to learn more about these two oneoff events This obviously cut into earnings last quarter and yet they still beat estimates My guess is that so long as they dont have any enormous and unexpected events during Q2 they are going to crush earnings Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic Google Trends shows it is now starting to compete with Truly and White Claw It is a healthier hard seltzer because it has vitamins I guess This competition came from only one variety pack They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors Moreover Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry  lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies Think about it The vaccine is highly distributed finally Summer is coming So many people are going to have BBQs go to baseball games go on vacations and just let loose And it is the summer of hard seltzerI dont think Wall Street understands how big pentup demand is for having a good time Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime weve ever seen before TAP is the ultimate recovery play

       " array(['PsychoMarket Recap  Friday May 28 2021Stocks gained on Friday with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending income and inflation and a strong Weekly unemployment report The market has made a remarkable recovery particularly in technology after the market tumbled 4 following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago In my view as I have said for weeks the recovery in the market confirms that the initial selloff driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblownNew government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April but still pulled back after Marchs stimulusfueled surge Personal income fell by 131 in April compared to March less than the 142 drop expected This follows a 209 increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of 1400 stimulus checks to most Americans In another report the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 31 in April from a year earlier blowing past the Feds traditional 2 target Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemics grip eases thanks to vaccinations and will have no impact on monetary policy Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory Supplychain constraints combined labor shortages in certain industries and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirusinduced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings These are all factors that are widely considered transitory meaning not permanent In an April 28 statement Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said An episode of onetime price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent yearoveryear inflation into the future Clogged supplychains wont affect Federal Reserve policy because theyre temporary and expected to resolve themselves Moreover he said For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up that would take some time and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen In other words Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesnt expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improvesIn remarks this week members of the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program In separate comments Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation Richard Clarida Vice Chairman of the Fed offered a slightly different view but one that is inline with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past Clarida said there will come a time in upcoming meetings when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that it is going to depend on the flow of data The Fed is currently buying 120 billion a month in governmentissued and governmentbacked securities and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recoveredThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will as they have said time and again wait for concrete data before any considerations are made This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14 which proves market participants shouldnt worry about quantitative easing tapering in my opinion Powell said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidanceThe Department of Labors Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemicera low an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report which showed 266000 new jobs added in the month far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp

continued Technology stocks continued their volatility with the Nasdaq QQQ going as low as 142 down intraday before recovering and closing 059 down The SP 500 SPY closed 026 down and the Dow Jones DIA closedStocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently which saw the SPY pulling back 4 before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index PPI came in higher than expected The CPI which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs rose 42 from a year ago compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 36 increase The monthly gain was 08 against the expected 02 Excluding the volatile food and energy prices the core CPI this is the main measure of inflation increased 3 compared to the same period in 2020 and 09 on a monthly basis The respective estimates were 23 and 03 The PPI which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 62 compared to April 2020 and 06 monthly increase The core PPI which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 46 year over year and 07 in April Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 03 monthly increase in April and 38 year over year This is the biggest jump since 2014 In tandem with the CPI report this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected While the readings in inflation definitely are not good it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not The April Job Report bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy In addition at a separate event in April Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper well before the interest rate is increased He said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance In short while the inflationary readings are not great Im fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy soonerthanexpected are overblown Just my two cents There are several factors in my opinion contributing to the rise of inflation First after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials limiting production capability and driving up delivery time and as a result driving up prices One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up inflation is expected to slow down In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory In an April 28 meeting Jerome Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits Federal debtincurred when the government sells Treasury bonds bills notes and other securities to cover its costsrecently hit an alltime high However policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels Jerome Powell said Given the low level of interest rates theres no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview saying Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected longterm bond yields declined indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserves commitment to move slowly when raising ratesHighlights On Monday morning ATT T and Discovery Inc DISCA announced a deal under which ATTs WarnerMedia will be spun off and combined with Discovery in a new standalone media company The new

Since GP is not publicly traded everything I share will not include them One thing I noticed with all of these companies is that in the past year their stock price has sky rocketed  West Fraser 130  Canfor 180 Weyerhaeuser 80 Resolute Forest 500Why is their price doing this it isnt like wsb is simping over it Looking at all of their filings for the SEC tells you exactly why their price has jumped it will also tell you why the price of wood has also skyrocketed and it isnt a jump in demand that caused their price to raise or the price of wood to raise These companies are just selling them for higher prices and pocketing the excess profitThere are 4 data points that support the artificial jump in prices Inventories Sales COGS and New Earnings below is the data for all 4 companies West

they grew their net earnings by over 72x COGS only increased by 65 which means the price of lumber or getting the lumber hasnt changed This jump in COGS is likely due to Norbord So even taking that out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year That is absolutely nuts That is a profit margin that went from 24 to 66 that is not normal either but we arent done lets look at the

significant increase in profit margin 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts  in 3 of these cases the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about while the remaining company looks like theyre geniuses for the growth they had All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition  Although Selling GA is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted The growth they experienced Id say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business This makes sense But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year its a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they dont want to lower them because they see how much more money theyre making Everything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons Let me know what you think in the comments This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future Thank you',\n",

defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent quantifiable valueCurrent assets include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year such as Cash and cash equivalents Prepaid expenses Inventory Marketable securities Accounts receivableNoncurrent assets include longterm investments that arent expected to be converted into cash in the short term such as Land Patents Trademarks Brands Goodwill Intellectual property Equipment used to produce goods or perform servicesA liability is the opposite of an asset its something a company owesCurrent liabilities refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year which may include Payroll expenses Rent payments Utility payments Debt financing Accounts payable Other accrued expensesNoncurrent liabilities refer to any longterm obligations or debts which will not be due within one year which might include Leases Loans Bonds payable Provisions for pensions Deferred tax liabilitiesLiabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future Shareholders EquityShareholders equity refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for Common stock Preferred stock Treasury stock Retained earningsIf  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns the  assets  and subtract all of the claims from third parties the  liabilities  the residual leftover is the owners equity Dueling ViewsRecord of capital invested  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assetsinplace  ie the assets that allow for its current operations to occurMeasure of current value  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants or at least accounting rule writers that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business todayLiquidation value  There is a third school with lenders to the firm among its primary  members who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm if you liquidated them today Fixed and Current AssetsThe Old Way Two or three decades ago the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at original cost net of accounting depreciationThe New Way As accounting has increasingly adopted the fair value standard there has been a move to mark assets to current market valueDivergent Effects The difference in values that you get for assets using the two approaches varies It is Greater on older assets than on newer ones Greater on fixed assets than current assets Financial Assets Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies private or public With  holdings of publicly traded securities the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete With equity ownership in other companies the rules can vary depending on    Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake 50 or a minority stake  The former will lead to full consolidation where 100 of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent companys financials with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or noncontrolling interest on the liability side and with  the latter the actual stake will be shown as an asset    With  a minority stake whether it is held for trading or as a longterm  investment With the former the holding will be marked to market With  the latter it will be shown at book value terms Intangible AssetsBig game  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets and  from that talk you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles brand name management quality etcBut different reality  In reality accountants are much better at valuing smallbore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles Goodwill After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item goodwill Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little    For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet a company has to do an acquisition    When that acquisition occurs goodwill is measured as the difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target companys asset value dressed up book value    It shows up as an asset because without it in place balance sheets would not balance Goodwill ImpairmentOld rules  For much of the last century goodwill once created in an acquisition  was written off on autopilot often amortized over long periods in equal  installmentsNew Rules In the late 1990s both GAAP and IFRS  rewrote the rules requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not To make that judgment accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged or decreased and goodwill  would be impairedIs it informational  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements in the sector and lag them by months and sometimes  years the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible Current LiabilitiesCurrent liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups Noninterestbearing liabilities such as accounts payable and supplier credit which represent part of normal operations Interestbearing shortterm borrowings such as commercial paper short term debt and the short term portion 1 year of long term debt Deferred salaries taxes and other amounts due in the short termWhen  computing noncash working capital we do not include interestbearing  short term debt in the calculation moving it instead into the debt  column Debt DueWhen companies borrow money it can take three forms1 Corporate bonds represent debt raised from public markets2 Bank loans debt raised from banks and other lending institutions3 Lease debt  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years Until 2019 only leases classified as capital leases qualified  but since 2019 operating lease commitments are also debtThe marktomarket movement on the asset side of the balance sheet has been muted on the liability  side of the balance sheet Bank debt for the most part is recorded as  originally borrowed and corporate bonds due are for the most part not  marked to market Debt detailsWhile  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due broken down  into current and long term there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes for most companiesThis additional information can be on three fronts1 Individual debt due with stated interest rates and maturities2 Additional features on the debt including floatingfixed and straightconvertible provisions3 A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due by year Shareholders EquityOld ways  The shareholders equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earningsNew ways The shareholders equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of marktomarket accounting with all of its contradictions',\n",

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th 2021 AMC meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210604amcmemestockscouldsparkmoreheatintheweekaheadasinvestorsawaitinflationnewshtml Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting Mays consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday and it could be hot after it surged in April Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected Equities were higher in the past week but the meme stocks were far hotter AMC Entertainment gained another 100 and was up 2700 since January Energy was the bestperforming major sector gaining more than 67 as oil prices jumped nearly 5 in the past week REITs were the secondbest performer up 31 followed by financials up 12 and technology also up 12 But its the meme stocks that took the headlines and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market People think this is new It completely isnt Dan Niles founder of Satori Fund said of the trading frenzy He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999 when companies added dotcom to their names to attract investor attention Whats new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets they can work from home and theres nocost trading Those are the differences Niles said on CNBC So if it gets people interested in investing thats great What I dont like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed he added You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if youre going to play in something like this Steve Massocca managing director at Wedbush Securities said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath  Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last Its going to be around as long as cicadas are he said The SP 500 in the past week gained 06 rising to 4229 just 9 points from its alltime high The Dow was up 07 to 34756 and the Nasdaq gained 05 to 13814  Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory Economists expect CPI to be up 47 year over year after Aprils 42 pace according to Dow Jones Core inflation is expected to be up 04 for the month and 34 year over year Im getting nervous Im seeing signs of a top Im systematically raising cash I think the market looks too expensive Massocca said Were going to shake off the dust from Covid The economy is going to be very very good and as a rule I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree He said the memes mania is just one sign but the spark for a selloff could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed Who knows what it is but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it the market is setting up for a 7 to 10 pullback at some point he said Who knows what starts it  One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market Fridays May employment report was being watched closely but the lowerthanexpected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being There were 559000 jobs added in May well below the 671000 expected Now the CPI report is the next point of focus ahead of the Feds June 1516 meeting The question is will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation or could it show that price increases are peaking Theres inflation out there You can see it everywhere said Massocca  Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year with many strategists targeting the Feds Jackson Hole Wyoming symposium at the end of August The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action Then it will slowly reduce its buying After that it could consider interest rate hikes now not expected by the market until 2023 Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least 120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities When the Fed backs off of that with tapering I think thats when you can go in and say OK we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because thats when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money he said Thats when things start to get dangerous to the downside For now Niles said hes staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street You want to stay away from this stuff now unless youre doing it in very small size he said There are just a few earnings in the week ahead One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday

into todays jobs report for May it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that Aprils report threw at investors One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago where the consensus expectation was for 1000000 new jobs and we only got 266000 since revised up to 278000 On the one hand data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a one off among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data On the other hand it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons Moreover if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weakerthanexpected jobs market in this latter scenario should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery Against this backdrop investors were hoping that todays May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions It did not But that might actually be a good thing Here are some key takeaways  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559000 jobs in May slightly below Bloombergsurveyed economists median forecast for a gain of 675000 The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27000 jobs  The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 58 though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate which moved from 617 to 616  Average hourly earnings rose 05 month over month again signaling lowerwage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected More new lowerwage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases It is hard to view 559000 added jobs as a disappointment but it does leave something to be desired explained LPL Financial Chief Market  Strategist Ryan Detrick There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day Mays jobs number did jump above Aprils disappointment but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066421BlogChart1pngssl1 Where do we go from here The US economy is still 76 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession and given the magnitude of that number we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lowerwage workers from returning to the labor market as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer In the last month about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report Also schools might be closing for the summer but daycare centers are reopening more broadly freeing parents up to find jobs Warmer weather everimproving vaccination trends and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook this cycle perhaps more than past cycles and for many that is the real story today The Federal Reserve Fed has made it clear it will tolerate nearterm inflation overshoots in order to achieve substantial further progress towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation Recent hotterthanexpected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Feds timeline for reducing their asset purchases which given their stated position will depend on strong payroll reports As such we find ourselves to a degree in a good news is bad news scenario as strong labor market readings could hasten the Feds timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy Todays report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its substantial further progress goal on employment and therefore all else equal will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports likely in the one million range before it begins to take action From a Fed intervention standpoint todays employment report likely found a sweet spot and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief For a deeper dive into the inflation picture check the blog on Thursday June 10 when data for the Consumer Price Index CPI measure of inflation is set to be released  Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months SP 500 is up an impressive 119 for the first five months of 2021 That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950 As illustrated in the graph above gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months MayOctober and even more so over the Worst Four Months JulyOctober We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 94 vs 147 for the top 20 first five months But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from lateOctober to yearend

CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066221BlogChart1pngssl1 As we noted a month ago the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality After a nearly 90 rally off the lows stocks could be ripe for a pullback especially during the historically weak month of June explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick But with the improving economy coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus we expect any weakness to be shortlived  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi2wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066221BlogChart2pngssl1 Here are some stats to think about regarding SP 500 performance in June  Since 1950 June is the 4th worst month of the year September February and August are worse  It has been higher the past 5 years in a row the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s  The past 10 years though June was up 10 on average ranking as the 7th best month  According to Sam Stovall of CFRA only 5 market declines in excess of 5 started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months since WWII In other words it isnt common for major market weakness to start in June  Building on this when the SP 500 is lower in June it is down by 29 on average This is the second smallest average loss with only December better at 25 We wouldnt be surprised at all if stocks took a welldeserved break in June but this month is rather misunderstood as a massive selloff or the start of significant weakness isnt likely as that isnt what June typically brings Lastly last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the SP 500 In fact the SP 500 was up more than 10 on the 100th day which historically is a great start to the year but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day when stocks are up more than 10 on day 100 the rest of the year has been higher 842 of the time and up 86 on average both well above what the average year does We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixedincome position relative to investors targets as appropriate  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066221BlogChart3pngssl1  Less Than 20 Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week but after jumping 77 percentage points it is now at the highest level since the end of April Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average Additionally the week over week increase was the largest since

longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202106060321AAIIConsAbove20png Historically lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the SP 500 going forward as shown below But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20 for the first time in at least 50 weeks performance has actually tended to consistently be positive In fact across each of the past six instances the SP 500 has been higher six months out every time Granted for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202106060321AAIIRangespng  CLICK HERE

has been a rather lackluster month for the market DJIA SP 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains Historically the month has opened respectably advancing on the first and second trading days From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of midmonth Here the market rallied to create a nice midmonth bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses The brisk post midmonth drop is typically followed by a month end rally

Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The US economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest its been since our earliest analysis in 2005 according to LPL Researchs proprietary Beige Book Barometer BBB The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserves Beige Book a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business ownerswhat we like to think of as Main Street rather than Wall Street The BBB gauges Main Streets sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text In the most recent Beige Book strong words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity but even that is a welcome shift The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVIDrelated restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick Sentiment is up and thats a great sign for the direction of the economy  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066321BlogChart1pngssl1 This was an important Beige Book in other ways Mentions of COVIDrelated words virus COVID pandemic fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book when the words first started to appear More concerning words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis The downside of the economys rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand which can ramp up quickly and supply which comes on line more slowly while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening Overall the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary while we expect reopening to be enduring There is still some risk around variants however and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter but theres still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets which are forward looking and gains may not come as easily but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound  SP 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that we wanted to provide an update on how current longterm returns for the SP 500 stack up relative to history The chart below compares the trailing one two five ten and twentyyear annualized total returns of the SP 500 to the SP 500s historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928 Were starting to move away from the easy comps in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows but the SP 500 is still up more than 40 over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return Over the last two years the SP 500s annualized return of 258 still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 106 On a five and tenyear basis the SP 500s annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10 All in all the last decade has been very good for US equity investors The only time period where the SP 500 has experienced belowaverage returns is at the 20year window where the 84 annualized gain clocks in at 25 percentage less than the historical average of 109  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202106060221CurrentvsAvg1png The chart below compares the SP 500s current returns over the last one two five ten and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis With mostly aboveaverage returns it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile and for most time periods the percentile rank comes in well above 50 The oneyear total return of more than 40 actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile while the twoyear return isnt far from the 90th percentile either Moving further out each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20year window and that reading isnt even close On the one hand the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors but the last 20 years havent even been mediocre  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202106060221PercentileRank1png Throughout history many investors have always worked under the assumption that longterm returns for the equity market are about 10 History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least as the average annualized oneyear gain of the SP 500 has been well above 10 With the SP 500s current 20year annualized gain currently at just 84 though what will it take for the SP 500 to reach doubledigit gains on an annualized basis over a 20year window For an idea given the strong performance of the last ten years a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean Only time will tell but if we operate under the unlikely assumption that the SP 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years its annualized twentyyear return would top 10 for the first time since August 2008 next September After that brief period above 10 from September 2022 through March 2023 it wouldnt again top that level until February 2029 In spite of the fact that the annualized 20year return would top 10 in those two periods though it still wouldnt get as high as the historical average of 109 in either of those periods This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong they also came shortly after one of the worst tenyear periods for US equities on record  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads20210606022120YearReturn1pngHere are

       " array(['The future is better foretold in the streets than in the morning newsOne thing Im exploring lately is how people on the ground tend to have a better read on things than experts  Obviously this is not always the case and I think when it comes to things like Covid and stuff its best just to follow the restrictions and what not  But immunology is deeply rooted in science and is easily testableI have a degree in economics so Im not one to sling the profession through the mud  But I think that some economists are attempting to bring a degree to certainty to the field that simply is not realistic  FA Hayek talked about this  Economist William White who predicted the 08 crash also talked about this  Im not the only one saying itI recently read in a book The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruis Zafn a passage that struck me  I will provide the original text in Spanish for those who speak it as his words are far more beautiful than my subpar translationEra un buen lector de la historia y saba que el futuro se lea en las calles las factoras y los cuarteles con ms claridad que en la prensa de la maanaHe had a good read on the future and he knew that the future was better foretold in the streets in the factories and in the troop quarters than in the morning newsx200BThe 08 CrisisWhen the real estate bubble burst in 06 and the financial system came toppling down in 0708 economists and central bankers were left scratching their head  They would eventually say that it was impossible to see this coming but in the Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission reporthttpswwwgovinfogovcontentpkgGPOFCICpdfGPOFCICpdf they debunked this and said that there was plenty of warningPeople on the ground at mortgage originator firms saw it coming  Consumer advocacy groups saw it coming  People at ratings agencies saw it coming  But at all levels they were ignored  There was an assumption that somehow via technology and financial engineering we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigmBut Michael J Burry saw it coming  He was a bit of an outsider and its no surprise to me that he would be the one to take a wider look at things and say wait a minutePeter Schiff saw it coming  I have mixed feelings about him as he has strong and oftentimes incorrect IMO political views  But what I like about Schiff is that he doesnt pull any punches  He didnt buy it when Bernanke said subprime is contained  A lot of people did  The market didx200B2021  Anecdotes from the groundMy mom traded in her car yesterday and she told me she was surprised that the were willing to give her 11000 for it  It wasnt in bad condition but this amount was surprisingly high to both of my parentsShe told me that a year or so ago they took the car into the shop because it was making a funny noise  They paid a lot of money to have it checked out but no problem or solution was found  My mom mentioned this to the people at the dealership and they even took it for a test drive  No problem  They were willing to give her the full 11000 no more questions askedTo me this looks like speculative behavior  Used car prices are going through the roof due to not only decreased supply but more importantly to increased demand with so much free money sloshing around in the system And since prices keep going up and up the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it regardless of the state it was in  Sound familiarHow about Warren Buffet saying hes seeing massive price increases all across the boardWhat about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub Look at the meme stocks  Look at Archegos  Look at Tesla  Speculation is running rampant right now  Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say lets not overcomplicate it its goin north  Ie the trend is up right now so its going to keep going up  What in the world kind of analysis is thatIn addition the SP 500 hasnt had a serious downturn since 2008 remember stocks always go up right  Covid doesnt count  It barely scratched the market and the rebound has been insaneI follow a channel on YouTube called Everything Money highly recommended this sub wont let me link it  The main analyst Paul has been investing since just before the dotcom bubble  He knows that its NOT normal for stocks to always go up  This guy isnt an economist  Hes not a new investor  Hes not some pundit  Hes an investor who has been battletested  Hes a guy on the ground  He knows this isnt normalx200BThe Stubbornness of Ineffective ParadigmsIn my own job as an Englishasaforeignlanguage teacher I have seen how many teachers stubbornly cling to ineffective methods that dont work  I had one friend today tell me that this is coming from a place of ignorance but I dont think their method of focusing on grammar works I told him in this case your ignorance is more insightful than their expert methodology  He is correct as my best students are those who do less grammar and have more exposure to real EnglishIt is the teachers who think they have to micromanage their students learning who simply end up getting in the way  We cant engineer the ability to speak a foreign language all we can do is provide contact to it and just like a baby learning their native tongue eventually it starts happening  Yet teachers cling to the false notion that it is through their deliberate efforts that students will learnAnd if such an ineffective paradigm can persist so stubbornly in this environment why not in others  How about the war on drugs  Can we simply force people to stop taking drugs  Does it make any sense  No  But people dont like to change their views  they cling to them  And I believe economists the Fed and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market and as long as we make the right adjustments via QE and fiscal policy we will be OKFA Hayek would call this the pretense of knowledgex200BConclusionI dont know whats going to happen and hey I could be wrong  Maybe stocks will always go up and well just avoid any major crises from here on out  It could happenThe issue is that the bulls and the central bankers never even seem to posit the idea that hey I could be wrong  To them its science  Physics  Math  Thats the economy thats the marketBut the market is not science  We can do our best to try and understand it but IMO part of having a true understanding of it is realizing that we will never be able to figure it out entirely and then planning our policies in such a way that takes into account our limitationsIm predicting that this situation is not sustainable and Im predicting that we are going to see some sort of crisis in some ways comparable to 2008  I believe that ultraeasy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis  I also believe that inflation will be a problem and perhaps a serious oneIm not shorting anything because I recognize that I could be wrong  Im still learning and developing my theory every day  But I am playing things very very conservativelyI am going to take the step to post this because by taking a position I will either learn through being correct or learn by being proven wrong   The worst thing anyone can do is take no position at all and neither succeed nor fail at anything and thus guarantee that they never learn or advance in any way whatsoeverGood luck to everyone',\n",

steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks As I have said before I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index where technology stocks sank and the SP 500 SPY fell 4 was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below Last week the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes which showed a larger increase than expected  The CPI which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs rose 42 from a year ago compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 36 increase The monthly gain was 08 against the expected 02 Excluding the volatile food and energy prices the core CPI this is the main measure of inflation increased 3 compared to the same period in 2020 and 09 on a monthly basis The respective estimates were 23 and 03 The PPI which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 62 compared to April 2020 and 06 monthly increase The core PPI which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 46 year over year and 07 in April Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 03 monthly increase in April and 38 year over yearWhile its difficult to pinpoint exact causes there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market  First after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials limiting production capability and driving up delivery time and as a result driving up prices As basic economics shows us when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities aka supply prices inevitably go up One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits Federal debtincurred when the government sells Treasury bonds bills notes and other securities to cover its costsrecently hit an alltime high However policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels Jerome Powell said Given the low level of interest rates theres no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview saying Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected longterm bond yields declined indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserves commitment to move slowly when raising ratesNow that we understand why inflation may be rising these are the reasons I think fears are overblown With the US economy reopening we are seeing a surge in consumer spending we saw a 108 increase in spending in March supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up inflation is expected to slow down In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitory In an April 28 meeting Jerome Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Moreover it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not Finally the April Job Report which showed the economy gained only 266000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy Highlights The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown  In a Ford factory in Michigan President Biden promoted his 174 billion plan to promote and accelerate

symptoms It was founded in 2008 and went public in May 2017  G1 has three main drub candidates lerociclib rintodestrant and trilaciclib plus one newer as yet unnamed drug Lerociclib a drug with no current assignable value but possible future paymentsThe first drug candidate lerociclib is being tested for multiple possible uses however G1 has entered into agreements with EQRx Inc and Genor Biopharma Co Inc such that these companies with test and commercialize the drug Genor Biopharma Co Inc has rights to commercialize this drug in the Asia Pacific region including Japan while EQRx Inc has rights to the rest of the world including the USA In return for ceding the testing and commercialization of lerociclib G1 received payments of 26 million and could receive up to 330 million in additional milestone payments in the future It is unclear at this stage in G1 will ever receive future payments for this drug it is unclear when these payments might occur and furthermore the amount of money under consideration 330 million is fairly small when compared to the possible funds from G1s other drug candidates  However the companies that purchased the rights to the drug did already pay 26 million for those rights so its likely they see significant possible future value in the drugThus taking all these pieces of info into account this report assigns this drug a fairly conservative future value of 2030 of the possible future payments or 67 to 133 million dollars This payment must be discounted as it may not start for 35 years and would likely continue over several years So if this possible future revenue is discounted by 8 for 8 years 054 multiplier this gives a current value to G1 of 36 to 72 million dollarsRintodestrant G1s 2nd drug some possible future valueWith regards to the 2nd drug candidate rintodestrant G1 is currently testing this drug for use in patients with  ER or HER2 breast cancer Beast cancer accounts for about 30 of all cancers in females in the USA  About 65 of breast cancer is ER which means that estrogen mistakenly signals the cancer to grow and sometimes even protects the cancer from the bodys own immune system To combat this there are several possible treatments but for many of the cancers a class of drugs called SERDs has proven to be very effective often when other treatments fail  SERDs promote ER degradation which can have many antitumor effects again primarily in use with cancers that have shown a resistance to other drugsCurrently only one SERD fluvestrant a competing drug sold by AstraZeneca is approved for use though several other SERDs including the G1 candidate rintodestrant are being tested  G1 began a phase I test of rintodestrant in 2018 and presented data from this test in 2019 and 2020 Based on the results of the phase I test rintodestrant is likely though as yet not proven to be more potent in binding and degrading ER which would lead to faster and more complete degradation of tumors  Additionally rintodestrant has been observed to have a lower incidence of adverse effects no severe side effects as well as no observed toxicity or bradycardia bradycardia refers to an abnormally lowered heart rate Furthermore rintodestrant is easier to administer as it can be given orally fluvestrant is administered by injectionBased on the successful phase I results G1 is now conducting a phase II trial of rintodestrant when used in combination with another drug Palbociclib   Palbociclib is a drug developed by Pfizer and the trial is of course being conducted with agreement from Pfizer  The results of this trial should be made public in the 2nd quarter of 2021 ie within a few monthsRegarding assessment of the current value of rintodestrant there are several problems  First off there is a competing drug fluvestrant currently being used and other competing drugs currently being tested While rintodestrant appears to have various advantages over fluvestrant the main possible advantage would be that its is more potent and though rintodestrant does appear to be more potent based on the completed phase I trial this has yet to be fully proven Additionally further testing of rintodestrant will take several more years and finally the current testing of rintodestrant is for use in combination with another drug Palbociclib and its unclear how revenue would be shared between these 2 drugs if any revenue ever occursThe current drug being used in these cases of breast cancer fluvestrant had 2020 worldwide sales of 580 million  In a best case scenario rintodestrant would take over most of these sales and these sales have room to grow However even in the best case this would not occur for 35 years or more and much of the sales would likely still go to Pfizer if their drug palbociclib was used in combination with rintodestrant  It seems likely that rintodestrant is a more potent drug than fluvestrant based on the phase I trial and also seems likely that rintodestrant has no major side effects and fewer side effects than fluvestrant It thus seems fairly likely that rintodestrant would eventually replace fluvestrant in large part if not completely if no additional drugs show up that are even more potent than rintodestrantThus I am estimating an optimistic assessment of the future income stream for this drug if there ever is one at about 350 million per year starting in 35 years This represents the current revenue stream with room to grow  but discounted for the possibility that the income is shared to some degree with Pfizer  I am further estimating the likelihood that G1 is able to realize this income stream at about 30 of course there is also a strong possibility they will realize a lesser amount of income  This 30 represents the chance that rintodestrant is more effective than fluvestrant it probably is is well received and able to mostly or partially replace fluvestrant it probably will if it is proven to be a better drug and finally that no competing drugs quickly emerge that are still more effective than rintodestrant unlikely but who knowsThus 30 of 350 million means a expected future income stream of about 105 million starting in 35 years or more but of course taking some years for the income stream to reach full strength even if everything goes well  Discounting the income stream at 8 for 6 years 063 multiplier leads to a present value of the income stream of about 66 million which equates to a current value to G1 of between 133 million and 200 million assuming a revenue multiplier of 2 to 3Trilaciclib G1s third drug which has far higher potentialThough G1 has a few other possible drug candidates one in particular they are considering its difficult to assign any value to these currently untested drugs Thus G1s third and final drug of note is Trilaciclib Trilaciclib has been tested and continues to be tested as a drug to be used to reduce myelosuppression ie protecting the bone marrow which can be greatly suppressed by chemo in patients receiving chemotherapy to combat diagnosed cancers in the body  Trilaciclib has already been fully tested thru phase 3 and proven to be effective in reducing myelosuppression in SCLC small cell lung cancer patients Based on this SCLC testing G1 has received from the FDA a positive PDUFA decision on February 21 2021 3 weeks ago  This means that patients receiving chemotherapy treatment for SCLC can now receive Trilciclib which is marketed under the tradename Cosela as part of their treatmentRegarding the positive effects of triciclib as proved through testing by protecting the bone marrow from chemotherapy triciclib reduces the rate of hematologic adverse events including neutropenia a condition caused by a reduction in certain types of white blood cells which in turn reduces the bodys ability to fight infection anemia reduction of red blood cells and thrombocytopenia reduction of platelets in the blood  This means patients can receive longer duration chemotherapy treatments and often still have fewer side effects Also the immune system functions better than chemotherapy without triciclib and thus the bodys own immune system is sometimes better able to help combat the invasive cancer and its effects  Also the reduction of chemotherapy side effects equates to generally shorter hospital stays with fewer problems which can save considerable money for the patients and insurance providersTo see how widely used triciclib would likely be G1 interviewed prescribers and found that 77 were extremely enthusiastic very enthusiastic or somewhat enthusiastic about the possibility of using triciclib with their patients  In their testing G1 found that patients living with SCLC and receiving Cosela took 100 to 200 longer to report adverse symptoms including extreme fatigue 7 months with Cosela versus 23 months with a placebo tested anemia 72 months with Cosela versus 38 months with a placebo and overall functional well being 76 months with Cosela versus 38 months with a placeboFinally the average treatment cost for a patient with chemotherapy who does not experience a grade 34 hematological event is a whopping 67800 while the cost with a grade 34 event is approximately 90100 with Thrombocytopenia 96000 with Anemia and 131000 with neutropenia  Thus the helpful effects of Cosela might be such that the insurance companies would be happy to pay 8500 the approximate cost each cycle of chemo for the Cosela treatment to hopefully greatly reduce the average treatment cost and the incidence of a grade 34 hematological event which carries even greater costs which are enumerated aboveRegarding the approved SCLC treatment for triciclib and the income G1 can expect from it  Approximately 30000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC every year and of this number about 22000 receive chemotherapy treatment Patients who receive chemotherapy need an average of 4 cycles of chemotherapy treatment  Cosela costs 1417 per vial but patients require 2 vials per dose 3 doses per chemotherapy cycle and 4 chemotherapy cycles on average Thus the total cost is 8502 for the average patient for one cycle of chemotherapy which equates to 34008 total average cost with the average 4 cycles of chemo per patient With about 22000 people being treated for SCLC this equates to a potential income stream of about 770 million per year this assumes most SCLC patients will eventually be using Triciclib which is what G1 appears to be projecting or at least hoping will come to pass  This in turn equates to an approximate value to G1 of between 154 billion to 231 billion assuming a revenue to value multiplier from 2 to 3 which might be a very conservative multiplier considering the drug is approved and sales have commencedIn addition to approval for use in patients with SCLC G1 is now testing or has announced testing for triciclib with patients of several other types of cancer including first line colorectal cancer triple negative breast cancer neoadjuvant breast cancer bladder cancer and non small cell lung cancer Some of these tests are well underway some are recently started and some have been approved but not yet started  Though G1 has to test its drug on each type of cancer seperately the mechanism by which triciclib protects the bone marrow is the same regardless of the type of cancer and for almost all types of cancer and all types that G1 is currently testing the drug functions in a completely different part of the body the bone marrow as where the cancer is located Thus if triciclib works well for SCLC cancer then it is likely it has approximately the same effects and symptoms as with other types of cancer with the exception of cancer which is specifically located in the red bone marrow  a small subset of all cancer typesFurthermore since G1 has already received approval for triciclib with one type of cancer testing on cancers in other parts of the body can be somewhat sped up as some of the results information from the SCLC testing can be easily applied to testing for other types of cancer Thus so long as G1 tests carefully and receives no unexpected results again they know what the results will probably be from the SCLC testing it will probably be easier to get future approvals for use with other types of cancer  Essentially G1 has to simply run similar trials to what they ran for SCLC and prove that they get similar results but its already expected that this will be the case since the functioning of the drug should have nothing to do with the type of cancer being tested so long as the cancer is not in the bone marrow where the drug functionsCurrently G1 is in phase 3 testing for one type of cancer colorectal  They have recently begun or will soon begin within the next 3 months two separate phase 3 tests for 2 types of breast cancer They are in phase 2 testing for an additional type of breast cancer and they recently began or will soon begin phase 2 testing for bladder cancer and NonSCLC lung cancer  Several other studies for more types of cancer are planned for 2021  Though some of these studies at least the one for colorectal cancer will likely complete in 2021 drug approval and thus revenue from these studies may not begin until 2022 but all of these studies may be completed and approved within 3 years possibly lessIn aggregate these trials that are underway or soon to be underway are for cancers diagnosed far more frequently than SCLC with patients of these types of cancers receive chemo at the rate of about 470k per year while SCLC patients receive chemo at a rate of about 22k per year  However its not clear that all patients receiving treatment for these cancers would qualify for treatment via triciclib and other problems could emerge so to be safe it would be best to ut this number by about 13rd so 313 thousand patients per year Thus the potential revenue stream from these other types of cancer combined would be about 3133322  1424 times as large as the potential revenue stream from SCLC alone This could using the same numbers as for SCLC eventually amount to income of 1096 billion per year which would in turn equate to a value to G1 of between 2192 and 3288 billion  Finally people in other parts of the world also get cancer and G1 has many patents and several agreements with other companies for these companies to commercialize triciclib in other parts of the world though G1 themselves still have the rights for most of the world outside the USA  It will likely be years before triciclib reaches much of the rest of the world in fact it will be years before triciclib is accepted for most types of cancer in the USA assuming this approval even comes  Still there is huge potential for this drug outside the USA as wellOther G1 DataLooking at other data beyond G1s current drugs G1 had 2073 million cash on hand at the beginning of 2021 and said that they expected their cash on hand to last them through 2022 Of course if triciclib sales are well underway for SCLC by the end of 2021 then they may never need to raise additional cash  G1 has also raised some licensing revenue in 2021 and this would further reduce chances they need to raise additional cash down the road Because the entire 2073 million will likely be used to fund future drug testing no credit will be given for it in this analysis of the value of G1 but this does mean there may be no concern about G1 having to raise more money and dilute there stock in the futureOne other interesting item of note regarding G1  Some of the earlier founders of the company have moved on to pursue other goals and the whole process of getting their first drug approved has taken years G1 was founded in 2008 and went public in 2017 Thus G1 may be open to a takeover from a larger drug company though G1 must realize the vast potential of triciclib So there is a chance that G1 could be taken over by a larger drug company though G1 shareholders might actually be better served if that never happened possibly making far more money by simply holding on and waiting for the revenue from triciclib to start arrivingValuation SummarySo in summary G1 has an estimated value of 169 million to 272 million from lerociclib and rintodestrant  They have an estimate value of 154 billion to 231 billion from the approved use of their primary drug triciclib though sales of this drug just started so it make take a year or so for this revenue to show up  However G1 has future potential future value of between 2192 and 3288 billion from the additional currently underway tests for triciclib though they probably wont receive any additional revenue from these other types of cancer for a year possibly more and wont realize this entire revenue stream for 3 years possibly more  They have even more potential revenue from still more testing of their drug with other types of cancer and from commercialization of their drug overseasG1 has a current share price of 2043 and a current market cap of 857 million  Assuming a 1 year value of 17 billion to 258 billion the estimated current value for lerociclib rintodestrant plus revenue from the SCLC approval for triciclib at a multiplier of 2 to 3 this computes to a current stock value of about 4050 to 6150 within about a year as the revenue for use of triciclib with SCLC starts coming in  So about a 98 to 201 return in 1 year However if all current triciclib tests go well and everything moves along without problem then G1 may be able to grow triciclibs revenue such that their stock value is from 2192 and 3288 billion in 5 to 7 years assuming about 34 years to complete all testing and an additional 23 years for revenue to reach its full potential  Additional revenue from overseas sales is possible but that would just be icing on the cake and its difficult to make an educated guess at what that revenue might be within 5 to 7 years This gives G1s stock an estimated 5 to 7 year value of about 256 to 384 times its current value 857 market cap divided by estimated future stock value  This last number may actually be conservative but there are also quite a few things that can go wrong in 5 to 7 years  Also there is a decent chance the company will be taken over which would mean an excellent short term return but nowhere close to a 256 to 384 baggerPossible Near and Distant Catalyst to G1s stock price going upAt any time they could be taken over by a larger company that sees potential in their Triciclib drug and other drugs to a lesser extent  Longer term 1 year they should see revenue growth from their one approval for Triciclib Down the road probably 5 to 7 years they may get approval for Triciclib for many other types of Cancer and could see massive revenue from this which could cause their stock to go up many times over its current priceThere are risks to this investment as with any other and there will be ups and downs and its not clear if any price movement will occur for as much as 9 months or more but I personally think this stock will eventually rise to many times its current valuation if everything goes well  You do need a 57 year time horizon possibly more for this one and even then its a riskDisclosure I have taken a long position in GTHX  I could be some idiot who knows nothing about anything so do your own

       " array(['What does Alibaba doFirst and foremost they are an online commerce platform They sell retail they sell wholesale they sell single items they sell container loads of items This also includes a logistics platform and global fulfillment network Cainiao Network and an ondemand delivery and services platform Eleme Then they also have a rapidly expanding cloud business in addition to some small entertainment gaming and other business units but in this analysis Ill mainly focus on the online commerce and the cloud business as they are the two pillars of Alibabas business strategySo lets look at the online commerce Is it doing well Well Its doing fantastic The last year it grew by 35 YoY Over the last 5 years online commerce sales increased by almost 500 from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020 To give you an idea 1 US dollar was roughly 708 RMB then so Alibabas online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly 615 Billion Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing In fact this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is Then the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22 to 165 billion RMB or 234 billion So how are they doing THAT well Simple They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020 They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users Essentially theyve got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINEDSo Alibabas online marketplaces include several websites but not just any websites In fact the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN THE WORLD Tmall and Taobao Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place The company presence is just mindboggling And to top it all off the business model is much lighter than Amazons for example Why Well Alibaba does not sell its own products it doesnt have any inventory doesnt have any warehouses which results in less expenses and a higher net profit How much higher Well Amazons latest net profit margin is 553 Alibabas 2471So the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibabas amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings In fact the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform Now the cloud computing is different In the 4th quarter of 2020 it finally broke even It is an important part of Alibabas longterm strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it In 2020 cloud revenues grew by almost 62 Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that wayOverall the company is growing fast roughly 38 increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70 in the last year We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well How are its financials though Well it has a lot of cash roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy In fact theyve got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares In the final quarter of 2020 they repurchased roughly 110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly but theyve approved a share repurchase plan of between 6 and 10 Billion If we see them acting on that plan investors could get very excitedSo the business is growing fast the financials look solid theyre starting to return money to the shareholders What about their priceWell the company is relatively cheap right now Their PE ratio is 255 with a forward PE of 206 Historically they have a PE average of 345 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so theres that Compared to their direct Chinese competitors Alibabas PE isnt actually that low but Id say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business Also if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments we can see that Amazons PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 1372 way higher than Alibaba Amazons PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibabas Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020But theyve also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them Basically we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal at least in my opinionIts no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY Yahoo finance screenshot Also most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them Its got better sales better net profit margin better brand presence better longterm strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo Vipshop JD Clearly its the better deal at least in my opinion but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20 of his Daily Journal portfolioNow this stock just looks to good to be true right Sort of Alibaba does have some issues but theyre of slightly different nature The main risks involved with the company are more political First of all you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military that dont provide proper financial statements and reporting that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government Now technically speaking just because a company is delisted doesnt mean that you cannot trade it but chances are that its stock price will be hurt A LOT Youd still be able to trade it overthecounter but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers wont support it I know that my broker eToro does not Still you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibabas stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange The ticker is 9988 but its essentially the same stock Personally I dont think thats going to happen but dont take my word for it Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delistingThat isnt all though Currently there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma its founder made criticised the Chinese governments approach to financial regulations As a result the IPO for Ant Group which is essentially Alibabas spinoff that deals with consumer financing and lending was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered More recently more regulations and restructuring was ordered While this has affected Alibabas business model to an extent the regulations have also affected Alibabas direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of 28 BILLION US dollars the biggest one ever handed so far They also ordered the company to stop its anticompetitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms So are the regulators finished with Alibaba Well we can only speculate The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies but as I said this is not something that you can know for certainSo whats the verdict Is Alibaba a good investment right now Personally I think so It is undoubtedly risky but the company offers such amazing prospects that its just crazy to miss out on I mean if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price wouldnt you Id recommend doing your own research into it but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and thats why it is my second largest holding and almost 10 of my total portfolioFinally Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectoryThats my analysis on Alibaba

customerspartners like Barstool PENN YouTube Google Twitch AMZN FanDuel PDYPY Roblox RBLX CoinBase COIN Visa V ApplePay APPL BetMGM MGM Spotify SPOT MicrosoftXbox etc and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet 2 in market share where you can tradebuy the fastgrowing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear caseshttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentsmysz54reviewingthebearcaseonpaysafepsfehttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentsmysz54reviewingthebearcaseonpaysafepsfethe link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including discussion of bear cases so Im not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that subMost of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth As an example EVrelated stocks PLUG BLNK QS LAZR NKLA BLDP etc get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some dont even have revenue yet worth billions While this assumption may be accurate it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate Because of this predictive nature its really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop When or if it will pop is anyones guess So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk  high rewardsBut what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners If your customerspartners revenue grows its more likely than not they are using more of your products or services Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customerspartners financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start For this reason Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potentialPaysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11 The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth1 PENN Reported May 7

As you can see these Paysafes customerspartners are reporting explosive growth While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost ie Draftking However here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe These companies reported earnings before Paysafe so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow  May 11Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customers earning growth These factors will also influence Paysafes future growth1 They are a monopoly when it comes to iGamingSport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG MGM PENN SKLZ etc2 Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again Also when reopening occur more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe3 They are 2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ more on this belowFinally both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimationPaypal earning  May 5 2021  Revenue 603 billion vs 590 billion expected by Refinitiv source httpswwwcnbccom20210505paypalpyplearningsq12021htmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210505paypalpyplearningsq12021html Square earning  May 6 2021  Square reported a

httpswwwcnbccom20210506squaresqearningsq12021htmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210506squaresqearningsq12021htmlSo I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th For those of you who dont know Paysafe they are not a small player Their transaction volume is about that of SQ 100 Billion If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple See the reddit link above for DD on valuationIn summary I think Paysafe is a low risk  high reward stock compare to other fintech Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward They got the 2nd largest digital wallet They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market I believe as a monopoly in iGamingSport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states CA TX NY FL begin to allow online sport betting This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has This is a massive high growth area and they own the space For these reason I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term

it is essential for regulators to address the issues surrounding the unlawful tactics that short sellers may employ in order to drastically reduce the share price of publicly tradedcompanies  I am writing this article using the example of On trak Behavioural Health Services The Company hereafter a publicly traded company  I have owned shares of this company in the past and may purchase shares of this company in the future  I will also include a few examples of other companies in this due diligence and everything writtenherein is merely my opinion  I am not a financial advisor  Please do your own research  This article is for entertainment purposes only Lets get to itWhat happened and why am I writing thisThe Company provides online mental health and behavioural health services for people suffering with mental illness and the platform is actually genious  The Company saw the need for access to 247 1on1 mental health care via online service which is much more accessible for individuals who require immediate care or are care avoidant  The service is widely used by people with substance abuse issues veterans trauma survivors etc  Furthermore The Companys modelling showed that providingthis type of health care online caused a huge savings benefit for the medical system and insurance companies on the whole because it treated the issues at the source online and often prevented very expensive post incident care think of police and hospital resources  Insurance companies and even Medicare and Medicaid were aware of the savings and included The Companys services in their health insurance plans  The Companys stock saw a meteoric rise from about 3 to over 100 as more insurancecompanies signed on to the serviceThen whatIn early 2019 The Companys stock was trading between 1015  A short selling research company under the name Culper Research began covering the stock and took particularissue with The Companys CEO at the time  Culper Research itself is neither a company or really a legit entity  It operates under pseudonyms and behind proxy servers with no real way of contacting them through any legitimate means  Often websites that they operate to provide their research publicly are registered to law offices or shell companies in the Caribbean or South Pacific  They mostly attack companies through social media platforms like twitter stocktwits shady websites etc and then pay to have articles submitted through the newswire via their offshore company  Anyway it was Culpers opinion at the time that The Company would be unable to secure insurance companies into their behavioural health services system so they provided research attacking The Companys CEO  The intial Culper hit piece was fairly tame it questioned The Companys fundamentals and ability to sign clients  Culper took particular beef with the CEO and filled the report with the usual FUD  The report coincided with a hedge fund taking a MASSIVE SHORT POSITION AGAINST THE COMPANY AMOUNTING TO 40 OF ALL AVAILABLE SHARES  So there was a lot of money behind this research and a huge interest in The Companys failure  Things didnt go well for Culper and the hedge funds associated with them and The Company signed more insurance companies and clients and the stock kept rising   This is when things turned ugly  Let me say this I have never seen anything so disgusting published across the newswire without any sort of legal repercussion  Culper Research paired with Hindenburg Research and stepped up their attacks immensely  You apes familiar with the GME short seller reports know how ugly they can get  In the subsequent reports Culper and Hindenburg accused the CEO of embezzlement sex crimes fraud misapproriation of shareholder money and even supporting wars  Racist jabsand questioning the character of the care providers were all listed in the report  The Companys stock briefly fell but recovered and kept rising in spite of the report  Upon reading it I contacted The Companys investor relations and notified them of the report which they said they were aware of and could not discuss how they were addressing this legally  The report was deleted from Culper and Hindenburgs website at a later date of courseWell the stock kept risingCulper and Hindenburg needed to step it up because their hedge fund clients were losing hundreds of millions of dollars  And step it up they did  They began publishing reports almost twice a week and referring to them over the newswire and spamming them across twitter  Stock message boards became flooded with individuals who would hyperlink the reports they issued and spread FUD  Message boards that were generally quiet were flooded with bearish messages and false statements  Culper and Hindenburg stepped up their illegal activity which was admitted in their own reports by contacting health care workers who work for the platform by pretending to need to behavioural health servicesthey provided  They would mask as being suicidal or depressed and then they would press the health care workers about their pay compensation packages what they know about the CEO and the company which health care insurance companies did they use etc  Culper and Hindenburg then released their findings in their weekly almost daily reportsFor example theyd write when we contacted the clinician using their service they told us that they only worked 20 hours a week and that they were not receiving compensation for mental stressStill the stock kept rising  Once again I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were contacting health care employees to uncover confidential information and that they were spinning it to create FUD  The Company said that they were aware of the issue and that they were advising their staff to be waryCulper and Hindenburg then began issuing reports which had patient information included  This was done to scare patients into thinking that their information was not secure  Once again this was all in their reports  My guess is that they had one of their own people hired by The Company and this health care provider proded patients for information  Either that or they were just flat out lying  The reports would say patient did not have any reduction in suicidal thoughts patient did not feel better at the end of the session several patients felt confused after the session  They would couple this information with a decline in client retention rates or turnover  Remember these are extremely vulnerable often care avoidant individuals who are desperate for mental health care  This is a sickening act in my opinion  I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were releasing client information and discussions in their reports and The Company gave me the usual response  The stock kept risingIn my opinion their latest nasty shot at The Company could very well be the worst  This is opinion and can not be proven but I suspect it to be true  The Companys largest signed clientwas Aetna Health Insurance followed by Cigna  It is my opinion that Culper and Hindenburg began to lobby Aetna and Cigna with their false reports accusations FUD and the patient information on an almost daily basis  The goal was to have these health insurance providers drop The Companys mental health services from their insurance plans  Many veterans and individuals locked at home with abusers or their own thoughts during the Covid crisis are dependant on these services in order to get through their daytoday and can not afford the care unless it is covered by their health insurance plans  Well if they were lobbying it worked  Aetna abruptly terminated their agreement with The Company and thousands of patients were forced to lose care with their health care provider or be transitioned to another provider  This was devastating  Hundreds of health care service providers lost their jobs and thousands of patients will likely no longer get the care they require  Upon announcing the termination of the contract with Aetna the stock dropped from 105 to about 28 or soI notified the company that Aetna was likely lobbied by Culper and Hindenburg and they responded that they needed to focus on patient care and patient transitioning at the moment but that A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAD MADE THEM AWARE OF THIS  Culper and Hindenburg have since deleted all these reports from their websites and Twitter accounts however The Company has all the reports and so do INow the hedge funds that backed Culper and Hindenburg still have a big problem  Despite the fall in the stock price the trading volume has been extremely low and they have been unable to cover most of their short position  The stock is still currently shorted to the tune of about 36 of the free float  On top of that much of their short position was taken between1015 per share so they are still way underwater  On top of that the company is recovering  They are signing Medicare and Medicaid care contracts  They are signing a serviceprovision contract with Veterans Affairs directly  Recently the Biden administration has earmarked 96bn for the VA and VA mental health services in the new 6tn budget  The CEO of The Company resigned his position and a new CEO a veteran in the health care industry was brought on as CEO  I believe the new CEO will be much more ruthless with Culper and Hindenburg and I believe that this is why they have deleted a lot of their research  If I were a betting man Id say that they have multiple lawsuits coming their wayWhy did I write thisA friend of mine was a military helicopter pilot who served in Afghanistan  He was a career military kind of guy who really loved his job and serving his Country  When he came back from Afghanistan he completely changed  A normally outgoing person he became withdrawn antisocial and began behaving oddly  He confided in his close friends that he was strugglingwith mental health issues but was afraid to seek help because of the stigma attached to it and fear of losing his rank  This is someone who would have benefited immensely from these services because they are 247 confidential and covered through health insurance  Sadly he didnt get the help he needed and committed suicide in 2017  Was Culper or Hindenburg ever held responsible for their actions  Do they simply withdraw into the woodwork  Will they continue to lobby other insurance providers in an attempt to drive the price down further  How many lives were lost and will be lost by people who are told that they no longer have access to mental health care servicesIm watching it closely but I feel like I have been beating my head against the wall because no one does anything to hold them accountableJosh',\n",

but I couldnt help myself Let me say it out loud SPCE has an argument to make Im here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult No company or stock out there is a guarantee I am not here to sell SPCE it is still high risk as before but thats the nature of space exploration isnt itCritique 1  Revenue  The company has millions in cash enough to continue burning for 2 years They plan to generate income via paying customers astronaut training low orbit cargoexperiment carry assignments transportation offerings sponsorship and more If this company doesnt see future earning possible why would they move forward to build more ships Why would they hire more staff Why would there be 3 other companies wanting to eat into their market share Critique 2  The Competition SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market leaving SPCE with zerotolittle gains Debunked  Lets start with the elephant in the room SpaceX Elon Musk has presented concepts for SN highspeed point to point travel getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch 1 Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city you would have to travel to a remote place to get on the supposed fast flight 2 Boarding this fast flight requires a suit up when you get into space launch you must train to do this you must wear an astronaut suit the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years its not going to happen flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time conveniencenot in a rocket at least 3 What is the main objective of SpaceX Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism Now lets talk about Blue Origin this is VGs biggest rival as of today but BO is clearing behind SPCE BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multiplanetary via space hotels this vision has faded off as of late BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could not meet its original goals its now pivoting out of necessity a company mission statement is important and BO is confused and lost The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing their ergonomics standard up and down flight experience the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE They dont have an airport to take off fromI could go on all day VG is founded by Richard Branson a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality entertainment and travel markets BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest VG is a no brainer VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systemsare you noticing a patternCritique 3  Death  Ive read the comments this is a disaster waiting to happen they will get canceled when thy kill somebodyfor the record this is a great critique and justified concern death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries Let me ask you has anyone died on a plane in a car crash a motorcycle perhaps skydivingcertainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash VG will have legal corners coveredI do not have a crystal ball I do not offer financial advice I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over anyone out there who is taking interest now you know SPCE is real This company is a retail favorite love it or hate it we are all unable to look away in an era of pentup travel demand the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE whatever your take wish them luckNOTE The wealthy pay 50000 to scale Mount Everest every year Everest is cold physically demanding and utterly dangerous why would they not regularly pay for SPCENOTE The cost to fly to space was over a million just years ago VG can fly you up for 250k',\n",

records driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by techstocks Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266000 jobs for the month of April far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 61 widening further from its prepandemic level of 35 This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that despite significant progress the labor market remains well below prepandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery Altogether the US remains roughly 82 million jobs short compared to prepandemic levels and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020In the past Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a string of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made With the April report disappointing it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soonSeema Shah Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook As we have heard several times in recent days even a very strong jobs number wouldnt have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace

build meat directly from plants and have their final product consist of the same attributes as actual meat products Beyond Meats products are designed to be more nutritional than that of regular meat although the nutritional aspects of plantbased meats have been questioned While plantbased meats may or may not be more nutritional than regular meat by shifting to plantbased meats people can positively affect growing global issues The issues which this company is trying to address include human health climate change constraints on natural resources and animal welfare Their products consist of the Beyond Burger meatballs sausage beef and more Besides certain Beyond Crumbles all of their products are certified Kosher and Halal As of December 2021 you can find Beyond Products available at approximately 122000 retailer and foodservice outlets in more than 80 countries In addition Beyond Meat has an ecommerce site which offers consumers bulk packs mixed product bundles and trial packs This company is constantly innovating and their RD as a percentage of revenue is higher than some of the biggest food companies Nestle Kroger etc at 78 Their stateoftheart innovation center is a 30000 sq foot building located in El Segundo California This companys mission is simple to understand through a unique and innovative approach make the best product that gets as close as possible to real meat all while benefiting the planetTotal Addressable MarketTAMIn 2020 the plantbased meat market was estimated to be valued at 43 billion and is projected to reach 83 billion by 2025 All that growth registers a compounded annual growth rate CAGR of 14 Much of the growth that we are witnessing is due to the growing vegan vegetarian and health conscious trends people are adopting Also many people are becoming more aware of the additives that are in the foods that they eat and the environmental problems that come with meat products All of these factors make Beyond Meat products appealing as not only do people enjoy knowing they are eating healthy but they can do their part toward slowing down environmental problems While the plantbased market may not be the largest Beyond Meat said they are going after the global meat industry The global meat industry is valued at 12 trillion and had a CAGR of 24 between 2015 and 2019 Perhaps the biggest discrepancy between these two industries besides how the various products are made and consist of is price Beyond Meats Beyond Sausage sells for 1030 a pound that is about 70 more than regular pork sausage One pound of factoryfarmed beef burgers at Walmart run somewhere around 3pound while one pound of Beyond Meats Beef Burger will run you around 625pound While the difference in pricing is certainly a lot that doesnt mean that people dont buy Beyond Meat products Going forward well have to see how much of a disrupter this company is to the global meat marketRecent DevelopmentsAcquisitionsThe new Beyond Burger launches at grocery stores nationwide April 27 2021  Beyond Meat recently introduced their new Beyond Burger which has 35 less fat and saturated fat and fewer calories than 8020 beef This new iteration will hit grocery store shelves beginning the week of May 3rd It will be available in a 2pack the brands first ever value 4pack and a 1lb Beyond Beef pack Dariush Ajami the Chief Innovation Officer at Beyond Meat said  We are continuously working on understanding beef flavor at a deeper level to ensure our plantbased beef platform delivers a delicious and satisfying sensory experience The new Beyond Burgers rich flavor profile resembles that of ground beef and extensive testing with our consumers validated this new flavor direction with likeability scoring onpar with 8020 ground beef burgers According to the University of Michigans 2018 Life Cycle Assessment when compared to traditional 8020 beef burgers the Beyond Burger has 99 less impact on water scarcity 93 less impact on land use requires 46 less energy and generates 90 fewer greenhouse gas emissionsBeyond Meat announces major retail expansions throughout Europe April 12 2021  Beyond Meat announced that they will be significantly increasing product distribution within thousands of European locations The plantbased foods market in Europe has seen sales grow by 49 over the last two years In the UK Sainsburys said they would double their distribution of the Beyond Burger nationwide Also Waitrose launched the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage The retailers together increased Beyond Meats presence in 445 stores In Germany Beyond Meat will be expanding their product offering in over 1000 German retail stores through Kaufland Tegut Famila and Real In Austria the Beyond Meat product selection will be expanded at SPAR and BILLA locations to a total of 1500 retail stores Migros stores in Switzerland will expand Beyond Mince distribution to 155 stores Nearly 1000 Albert Heijn and Jumbo stores in the Netherlands will now offer Beyond Mince Chuck Muth the Chief Growth Officer at the company said These new and expanded retail partnerships throughout the continent serve as strong proof points that Europes appetite for plantbased meat and Beyond Meat products in particular is on the rise Moreso in June 2020 Beyond Meat announced its first comanufacturing facility in Europe in partnership with Zandbergen Worlds Finest Meats in Zoeterwoude NetherlandBeyond Meat opens manufacturing facility in China to accelerate localized production and innovation April 7 2021  Earlier last month Beyond Meat opened a new advanced manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic and Technological Development Zone located near Shanghai Ethan Brown CEO said The opening of our dedicated plantbased meat facility in China marks a significant milestone in Beyond Meats ability to effectively compete in one of the worlds largest meat markets We are committed to investing in China as a region for longterm growth and we believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plantbased proteins that are good for both people and planet Just a little over a year ago Beyond Meat entered mainland China through a nationwide partnership with Starbucks In addition to Starbucks Beyond Meat has partnered with multiple other food services such as KFC Pizza Hut Jindingxuan GangLi Beijing Slow Boat Brewery Hema METRO China and more Beyond Meat has been expanding so heavily in China that theyve even made a product specifically for the Chinese Market Beyond PorkWhat could go wrongFoodservice doesnt pick up  Beyond Meat has a number of strategic partnerships with restaurant chains in various countries In the past weve seen that whenever they announce a new partnership with a food chain their stock jumps dramatically only to fall back to where it was before a few days after Beyond Meat has partnered with the likes of Pizza Hut Taco Bell McDonalds KFC and a number of other restaurants Looking at the foodservice side of their business theyve seen tremendous YoY growth While Covid has impacted their business significantly in terms of foodservice sales many investors still remain optimistic that this side of their business will bounce back While they will likely continue seeing growth going forward I remain skeptical as to how all these strategic partnerships will play out Impossible foods is their main competitor and theyve partnered with the likes of Burger King White Castle Red Robin and others These partnerships with respect to both companies have played out well as shown by the YoY growth in foodservice revenue The questions that remain to be asked are in the longrun how many of these restaurants will create their own meat alternative products or stop doing business with Impossible foods or Beyond Meat Taco Bell has already begun testing their own plantbased protein products and how many others will follow Furthermore Beyond Meat has been relying on new partnerships to boost foodservice sales There might be a point to where the growth in foodservice revenue stops as a result of their not being worthy partnerships with restaurant chains and what happens then Nonetheless I remain optimistic for the time being that Beyond Meat will see their foodservice revenue increase rapidly for the next couple years',\n",

spooked us this week like inflation are going awayI think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks Fundstrat cofounder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic like airlines and hotels are ready to rise off the bottom He is still concerned about the tech sector which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care  Fed Ahead The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting But that was held before Aprils Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 42 year over year That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266000 payrolls a quarter of what was expected I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points Theyre thinking that one data point is not a trend said Joseph Song senior US economist at Bank of America But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying That would be a precursor to slowly ending the 120 billion a month asset purchase program and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates Hogan said when the weak employment report was released the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday We saw hot CPI hot PPI said Hogan referring to the producer price index That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper down nearly 2 for the week  Retail earnings and housing Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday Target TJX and Lowes release results Wednesday and BJs Wholesale and Kohls on Thursday Another disappointing data point was Fridays Aprils retail sales which came in flat with March But they are still at a high level Hogan said based on the sales report retailers should have done well Youre likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming It used to be Walmart Target Home Depot Lowes said Hogan He said now others have joined the list like TJX and Gap and should do well Besides earnings there is housing data The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday and housing starts are published Tuesday Existing home sales will be issued on Friday Hogan said depending on the data it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week He noted that DR Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week The home building index is off 5 for the week even with it being up 1 Friday This is a redhot sector that has lots of implications he said Whats good for home sales is good for auto sales Its good for Home Depot and Lowes Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday Scott Redler chief strategist at T3Livecom said by the end of the week some of the growth and tech names were trading better like Facebook and Alphabet The SP 500 held the 50day moving average which is constructive he said The SP 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50day which is the average price of the last 50 closes It is often a level that acts as support but if it is broken it can signal a negative trend The SP 500 was down about 15 for the week at 417385 The Nasdaq ended the week at 1342998 down 23 on the week The tech sector which has been under pressure held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week Redler said Friday It doesnt mean you can go into everything but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices This past week saw the following moves in the SP CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL SP TREE MAP FOR THE PAST

not foresee any major upside either over the next six months  the Worst Six Month of the year MayOctober We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical Reposition in May period The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pentup pandemic demand Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months NovemberJune and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns Though we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000 If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the

developed international stocks recently for several reasons For one the US stock market has staged a tremendous rallythis week notwithstandingsince last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that arent pricing in so much optimism Valuations though not great timing tools are more attractive in Europe and Japan And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost nonUS stock returns Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks The developed international equity market mainly Europe and Japan is much more valuefocused than the US market based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the SP 500 Index As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the US In other words international tends to work when value works  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads20210551321BlogChart1pngssl1 Should strong performance by value stocks continueand we suspect it mightinternational stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials industrials and natural resources coupled with tech sector weakness gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the US as those economies fully reopen We can see how developed international stocks are more valuefocused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes As shown in the graphic below the US equity market represented by the SP 500 Index has a much higher technology sector allocation making it a more growthoriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities If digital media think Google and Facebook which are categorized as communication services and ecommerce think Amazon which is in consumer discretionary are included in this sector comparison the technology gap widens even further In essence for international to outperform US technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads20210551321BlogChart2pngssl1 At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the US is seeing now those markets may be in an even better position to outperform Until then we maintain our slight preference for US stocks over developed international  Bullish Sentiment Down Big The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill dropping 78 percentage points to 365 Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multiyear high at 569 this weeks reading was the lowest since the last week of October  CLICK HERE FOR THE

In todays Morning Lineup we covered some of the details of this mornings release of the NFIBs monthly survey on small business sentiment The survey showed rising prices tight labor market conditions and overall improving demand The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues For the majority of businesses cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent In total 64 of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem Meanwhile the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from big business Only 7 of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017 While up 1 percentage point in April cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses

pressure and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants The Nasdaq QQQ sank 253 its worst performance since March Meanwhile the Dow Jones DIA reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the SP 500 SPY retreated from record levels closing 095 downMarket participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices This in turn may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soonerthanexpected pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks However it is important to note that monetary officials including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be transitory In an April 28 meeting he said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Looking ahead the US Bureau of Labor Statistics April consumer price index CPI is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index PPI on Thursday These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers and are expected to show a significant jump over last years pandemicdepressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopensFurther spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from overheating She said It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesnt overheat even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive I think our economy will grow faster because of them In later remarks she seemingly downplayed her remarks saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve She said Let me be clear thats not something Im predicting or recommending If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed I think that person is meWhile it may seem like doom and gloom this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldnt begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating Last Friday the April Job Report reported only 266000 jobs added in the month of April missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916000 jobs added in March Despite significant progress the economy remains roughly 82 million jobs short compared to prepandemic levels and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020 The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a string of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made With the April report coming in far below estimates the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soonIn short a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020 and while substantial progress has been made economic recovery particularly in the labor market remains far from completeHighlights Pfizer PFE and BioNTech BNTX submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK anticipating GDP will grow 725 in the country up from its forecast for 5 growth in February The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 25 in 2021 up from its prior forecast for 2 but said the rise in price pressures will likely be temporary The trial between Epic Games vs

       " array(['Preamble The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legalityethical aspects of this what I wanted to know isDid Congress members beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made publicWhere is the data from senatestockwatchercomMassive shoutout to urambat1994httpswwwredditcomurambat1994 for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public The website has data of Congress trading from 2019 While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site given that we have more than 9K trades to work with I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective Also please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their tradesWhile Congress members are supposed to report the transaction within 30 dayshttpswwwcitizenorgarticlepersonalfinancialdisclosurerequirementsforpublicofficials the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediatelyAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the endAnalysisA total of 9676 trades were made by the members in the past two years This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself Out of the 4911 Buys what I am really interested in is the 1375 transactions which were over 15K I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions 5K to affect the analysis The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10 of their annual salary into one trade they should be very confident about the stock I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarilyResults For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against SP500 returns during the same perioda One Monthb One Quarterc Till Date From the date of purchase to TodayReturns made by the CongressAvg Return Change in Price Change in SPYChange over SPYOne Month255242012One Quarter876742134Till Date32402640599At this point it should not come as a surprise but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods But what I am really interested in is if its possible to follow their trades after disclosure after a time lag of 30 days and still beat the benchmarkReturns if you followed their trades after the disclosureAvg Return Change in Price Change in SPYChange over SPYOne Month20248048One Quarter1046789257Till Date29622373589If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure you would beat SP500 over the long run My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden shortterm gains can put a spotlight on their trades This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profitLimitations of analysis There are multiple limitations to the analysis1 The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run So the results might change in a market downturnrecession2 The data has been sourced from senatestockwatchercom as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them you can find it in the google sheet I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress3 There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress The disclosure is always in ranges eg 100k  200k So for calculating the investment amount I have taken the average of the given rangeConclusionThis analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stockpicking capability is something that cant be proven from the data and is left to the readers judgment I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysisWhichever side of the political spectrum you leanto the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their tradesLink to Google Sheet

difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action but I think there are two main competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so It seems that fears inflation marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March bolsters confidence in the Feds claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a string of strong labor reports Again though with so many factors revolving around the market it is difficult to see the clear pictureThe SP 500 SPY closed the day 117 up after closing 209 down yesterday The techheavy Nasdaq QQQ closed 077 up after closing 254 down yesterday The Dow Jones DIA closed 126 up after closing 2 down yesterday Yesterday the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index CPI which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs rose 42 from a year ago compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 36 increase The monthly gain was 08 against the expected 02 Excluding the volatile food and energy prices the core CPI this is the main measure of inflation increased 3 compared to the same period in 2020 and 09 on a monthly basis The respective estimates were 23 and 03 Today the producer price index PPI which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 62 compared to April 2020 and 06 monthly increase The core PPI which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 46 year over year and 07 in April Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 03 monthly increase in April and 38 year over year This is the biggest jump since 2014 In tandem with the CPI report this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected However while the readings in inflation definitely are not good it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before In an April 28 meeting Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businessesMoreover the April Job Report released last Friday showed the US economy only added 266000 new jobs last month missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from Marchs total of 916000 new jobs added As said earlier members of the Federal Reserve including Powell have consistently reiterated they want to see a   String of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not The April Job Report bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy In addition at a separate event in April Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper well before the interest rate is increased He said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance In short while the inflationary readings are not great Im fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown Looking ahead though I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term Just my two cents Highlights The Labor Department Released its Weekly Unemployment Report    Initial jobless claims 473000 vs 490000 expected and 507000 the previous week    Continuing claims 3655 million vs 3650 million expected and 37 million the previous week

from a team of researchers from USF Daniel Bradley Jan Hanousek Russell Jame and Zicheng Xiao In the wake of the GameStopMelvinRobinhood clusterfuck and subsequent congressional hearing in January these researchers manually read through a huge number of DD posts on rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets and tracked the results of these predictions They concluded that predictions on this subreddit perform very well on average In the debate about whether reddit posts mislead retail investors it certainly seems like they do notThe article does a decent job of concisely summarizing the researchers papers but the fine folks over on rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets didnt really get the point of the article Maybe they skimmed it Maybe they cant read I dont know Either way when the article was posted on that subreddit it was treated with derision never change WSBAs a side note whenever you come across an article on a popular publication that reviews a scientific research paper you should try to find and read the actual paper Often the summary misinterprets the results of the paper and even if not they definitely leave out some really important or interesting results In this case the actual paperhttpsposeidon01ssrncomdeliveryphpID710087064097089109073116009067086122015017095012001064108080023002087014024122090093101099062003019016045100086115111100005029007087059020059072074070018006118068031021076024031087127076020075109119113072095069023096097001091085000025010076027126000EXTpdfINDEXTRUE contains a huge depth of interesting auxiliary results and conversations almost none of which are covered in the Business Insider article and I wont cover even half of them in this writeupThis article came out about two weeks before I was wrapping up a text mining project that was asking the exact same questions What immediately struck me was the fact that these researchers only looked at one subreddit I had been tracking predictions in three rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets but also rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks and rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks As such I feel I can add some perspective that the researchers missedIm a university student studying theoretical math This started as a semesterlong project in a text mining class and I present the most relevant results from my findings here I am not a professional in this field and this is not financial advice DataI wanted to only take predictive posts that mention a particular stock ticker in these subreddits so I only selected flaired posts  DD in WSB and rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks and ticker discussion in rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks I had to exclude rinvestinghttpswwwredditcomrinvesting since that subreddit does not have flairs The USF researchers did the same taking DD posts from WSBI also wanted to avoid the GameStop posting frenzy on these subreddits and take predictions old enough so that by April I could measure their success or failure after at least six months As such I selected posts between January 1 2019 and October 1 2020The team from USF similarly wanted to filter out GameStop frenzy on rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets but they focused on success or failure of posts over a shorter time interval looking primarily at twoday returns and three month returns Their data ranges from 2018 to December 2020 although they do not give specific datesI used pushshift to collect my data set Not sure what the research team used MethodsThis distinction is crucial The team from USF looked at every post in their data set manually and noted the stock ticker mentioned and prediction direction I used text mining to do this instead The clear upside to my method is the fact that I was able to look at more posts especially giving me the ability to compare returns and trends across different subreddits Obviously my results are not guaranteed to be perfectly accurate like theirs though With that being said I used a number of text mining approaches some simple some sophisticated and I am confident that my results are very accurate After using text mining to isolate ticker symbols in these posts I ended up with over 4000 predictions across all three subreddits 1253 in rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks 644 in rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks and 2628 in rwallstreetbetshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetsI also used sentiment analysis to obtain a prediction direction for each of these posts either buy or sell The research team reading every post manually always isolated the correct prediction direction but sentiment analysis is more finicky With that being said several tests confirmed my method worked very well too Ill spare you the detailsIll note here too that the researchers collected a lot more data than I am mentioning here including retail trading volume of particular stocks on the day popular posts were made and correlation between number of posts made about a stock and that stocks price change Theres a lot of cool stuff in their paper I encourage you to read all of ithttpsposeidon01ssrncomdeliveryphpID710087064097089109073116009067086122015017095012001064108080023002087014024122090093101099062003019016045100086115111100005029007087059020059072074070018006118068031021076024031087127076020075109119113072095069023096097001091085000025010076027126000EXTpdfINDEXTRUE ResultsBefore I get into results it is worth noting that the vast majority of these predictions were made during a massive bull run This section should not be construed as financial advice nor a suggestion that every post on these subreddits will always have these returnsI started by looking at 6month returns on predictionsHere are the results as a nice tablehttpsimgurcomF3PzwyRIn rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks the median 6month returns on these predictions was 63 with mean returns of 234 This discrepancy is driven in part by the fact that 8 of predictions reached 10x value over the course of 6 months A natural question arises maybe all of these predictions that 10xed were about the same stock I checked this but no single stock ticker was responsible for more than 19 of these 10x predictionsIn rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks median 6month returns reached 35 with mean returns of 71 There were no predictions I collected in my data set during this time frame from rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks that reached 10x value over 6months It is possible that those do exist and I failed to scrape the ticker symbolIn rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets median 6month returns reached 34 with mean returns of 71 2 of these predictions 10xed However I went back and checked these and 70 of these 10x predictions were about GME these were the first few posts before October that started the frenzy thanks DeepFuckingValue Removing these returns from this subreddit still had median 34 but mean returns fell to 52A few takeaways  first these are massive extremely impressive returns even during huge bull run This augments the USF teams argument that reddit investing communities are NOT misleading retail investors However it is worth noting that rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets seems to perform the worst on average It does have its reputation for a reason more on that laterI also simulated what would have happened if an investor put 1 into prediction in my data set at the time of the prediction then pulled their money out all at once in March 2021 I compared this to what would have happened if they had put the same amount of money at the same time in VOOHeres another nice table of resultshttpsimgurcomqNo6bHCrpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks performed the best I found 1253 predictive posts in this subreddit between January 1 2019 and October 1 2020 and if one had invested 1 into the stock mentioned by each prediction they would have realized 290 returns on their investment by March 2021 If instead they had put this money into VOO at the same time their returns would only have been 24 Again many of these posts were about stocks that ultimately saw at least 5 times increase in value In rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks this was a very diverse group of stocks but Microvision MVIS and CleanSpark CLSK are two very popular tech companies on this subreddit that each saw their value skyrocket There were 30 predictions about these companies and excluding these returns from this subreddit would still have reached a whopping 250For rStockshttpswwwredditcomrStocks if one had invested 1 into every stock mentioned by predictive posts they would have realized 152 return on investment on a total of 644 predictions over the same time frame VOO returns would have only been 24 However these returns were driven by the popularity of Tesla TSLA on this subreddit a stock which also grew tremendously in value Removing 40 predictions about Tesla returns in rStockshttpswwwredditcomrStocks would only have reached 134In rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets someone using the same investment strategy would have realized 112 returns by on 2628 predictions from the same time frame If this investor had put that money into VOO instead they would have made 26 returns these posts were made at slightly different times than posts in the previous subreddits so returns on investments in VOO made at the same time would not necessarily be the same as before Again Tesla and GameStop are popular companies on this subreddit that performed well over this time frame Excluding these rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets returns would only have reached 77Again very impressive results but take them with a grain of salt  its been a huge bull run recently Still we have to agree with the USF researchers that reddit communities are not misleading retail investors Although yes rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets still performed the worst Word ChoiceThis is my favorite part I used a modified version of a text mining technique called Dunning LogLikelihood ratio to examine word choice disparity across the three subreddits In essence it takes relative word frequency across the three subreddits in addition to how often those words are used to figure out which words are more characteristic of posts on each subredditFor example the is used a lot on all three subreddits but at almost the exact same frequency so the gets a score close to 0 intercept is used very rarely in any DD posts but for some reason a little more often in rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks so it gets a smalltomedium positive score in rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks and a negative score in rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks and rwallstreetbetshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbets fuck is used decently often in all three subreddits but WAYYYY more often in WallStreetBets so it gets a high positive score in rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets and a negative score in the othersHere are the top 40 wordshttpsimgurcomafI38Wu7 for the three subreddits Remember text mining is not perfect so not all typos are taken outIn rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks the top words are as expected  things like growth dividend opinion and portfolio rise to the topIn rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks I was surprised by how many pharmaceutical terms rose to the top  fda clinical and developmentAnd finally the rWallStreetBetshttpswwwredditcomrWallStreetBets results are glorious The top 40 words include shit 3 variants of fuck calls puts tendies autists and retardsSlightly longer tldr The USF researchers concluded that rwallstreetbetshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbets is not misleading retail investors since their predictions tend to perform very well Some took this to mean that traders on rwallstreebetshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreebets are skilled but in fact WSB gets beaten by rstockshttpswwwredditcomrstocks on average and these both get beaten by predictions on rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks by a lot See results above for exact numbers This only strengthens the argument that reddit is not misleading retail investors Also rpennystockshttpswwwredditcomrpennystocks likes pharmaceuticals and rwallstreebetshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreebets word choice is quantifiably as vulgar and degenerate as we know it to be Again see word choice for some funny auxiliary results',\n",

beats timing the market but hear me out I do recall Benjamin Graham also didnt really understand this whole thing but I have reason to believe if Im as shrewd of an enterprising investor as the man suggests I should use every tool at my disposal in order for a better informed decision to be made If I want a good suit and the offer on the tag is 1000 I can take it at market value or choose to negotiate the price to end up with a good 1020 discount Thats approx 200 saved just by talking A save that you can get a good shirt knickers and socks to go with your new suit This is how I see price action technical analysis Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share Now to businessApple IncTicker AAPL  has been ranging since last year between 100 and 140 This is promptly after we had the split from 330 You would imagine that some investors who werent involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price The distribution schematic charthttpsimgurcomvoCVxwf and annotations for visualAt PSY which we would call the preliminary supply is where the first batch of selling took place hence the pause in price at the level But as you would have guessed investors bought the dip which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax BCLX At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given this is why its so easy for the big guys to distribute  liquidate his positions while we prop up the priceWith the first batch distributed price will automatically drop back to support  this is the automatic reaction AR This is obviously because there arent any strong hands fully committed to the stock anymore at least at that point in timeBut since we keep buying the dip not just novice investors even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure price will rally up again until the secondary test ST Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to support Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping While doing this it creates a low higher than the previous meaning  the stock is still trending upwards giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higherThis is why after the up thrust UT price drops just a little then pushes even higher This would be the up thrust after distribution UTAD The big money here has now left the party Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume see bottom of the screen This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a big mistake to sell their Apple holdings but heres something you should understandAn investor cannot stay married to his investment for life His aim is to get in at a good price get out when his objective has been met making a good profit out of the situation Warren and his partners bought low and sold dear  as they always advise made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example Once the shares have been distributed into the market price keeps dropping The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market This means once we buy the dip off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummetingWhy I believe were reaccumulating now Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support inducing fearhttpsimgurcomoCYJz0l and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeksmonths on the company or missed earnings This contribute to price declines While this may be seen as negative institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions sometimes even fund managers who dont know what theyre doing will sell out during bad news and declines This would be the process called a terminal shakeout or a spring This is when a lot of fear is in the market shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands uninformednovice investors to strong hands In situations like these buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ceiling thats been keeping it lowThis level is where my limit ordershttpsimgurcommqm1yyv are placed Once price has strong commitment big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a markup would ensue This whole process can take weeks or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does The analysis here is based on price behavioral systems developed by Richard D Wyckoff a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof Hank Pruden from San Francisco Golden Gate University With this you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boardsI would enjoy a healthy commentary below Best wishesTLDR AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeksmonths The best prices to buy in may be around 85100 and targets are set to record highs 300 The range may be coming to an end',\n",

records driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by techstocks Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266000 jobs for the month of April far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 61 widening further from its prepandemic level of 35 This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that despite significant progress the labor market remains well below prepandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery Altogether the US remains roughly 82 million jobs short compared to prepandemic levels and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020In the past Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a string of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made With the April report disappointing it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soonSeema Shah Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook As we have heard several times in recent days even a very strong jobs number wouldnt have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace

but I couldnt help myself Let me say it out loud SPCE has an argument to make Im here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult No company or stock out there is a guarantee I am not here to sell SPCE it is still high risk as before but thats the nature of space exploration isnt itCritique 1  Revenue  The company has millions in cash enough to continue burning for 2 years They plan to generate income via paying customers astronaut training low orbit cargoexperiment carry assignments transportation offerings sponsorship and more If this company doesnt see future earning possible why would they move forward to build more ships Why would they hire more staff Why would there be 3 other companies wanting to eat into their market share Critique 2  The Competition SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market leaving SPCE with zerotolittle gains Debunked  Lets start with the elephant in the room SpaceX Elon Musk has presented concepts for SN highspeed point to point travel getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch 1 Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city you would have to travel to a remote place to get on the supposed fast flight 2 Boarding this fast flight requires a suit up when you get into space launch you must train to do this you must wear an astronaut suit the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years its not going to happen flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time conveniencenot in a rocket at least 3 What is the main objective of SpaceX Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism Now lets talk about Blue Origin this is VGs biggest rival as of today but BO is clearing behind SPCE BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multiplanetary via space hotels this vision has faded off as of late BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could not meet its original goals its now pivoting out of necessity a company mission statement is important and BO is confused and lost The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing their ergonomics standard up and down flight experience the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE They dont have an airport to take off fromI could go on all day VG is founded by Richard Branson a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality entertainment and travel markets BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest VG is a no brainer VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systemsare you noticing a patternCritique 3  Death  Ive read the comments this is a disaster waiting to happen they will get canceled when thy kill somebodyfor the record this is a great critique and justified concern death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries Let me ask you has anyone died on a plane in a car crash a motorcycle perhaps skydivingcertainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash VG will have legal corners coveredI do not have a crystal ball I do not offer financial advice I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over anyone out there who is taking interest now you know SPCE is real This company is a retail favorite love it or hate it we are all unable to look away in an era of pentup travel demand the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE whatever your take wish them luckNOTE The wealthy

more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories news and tickers to share with the community I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it

companies that are good to work for A couple of ETFs mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this setETFs   ICLN etf focusing on clean energy should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden I own a couple shares and so does my spouse    TAN solar ETF same rationale as above   PBW clean energy ETF same rational as above   Then we have RKT Rocket Companies including Rocket Mortgage Innovation in an old field Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout   All 24000 employees had shares during toprior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 2475 and it was 2265 so only a small upside at current prices   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below Not sure yet I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that

shares worth 12 million This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sureFDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car I own both tickersFrom market sentiment we have some factsRKT fell 16 Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236 and net income up 170 but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations May be good entry point if youre bullish long term Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of

storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same

httpswwwmarkovchainedcomprofilesviewredditF1rstxLas7 Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them so why shouldnt we do the same on redditIntro iRobot  Roomba got it Its really that simple Its a household name brand that sells their robot vacuums as well as automatic floor mopping robots a robot that teaches kids to codethis speaks directly to my heart and their new robotic lawn mower Incorporated in 1990 Headquartered in Massachusetts blah blah blah Bear case Yeah were going to do this analysis a little differently There have been a few good threads examining IRBT most of which have the same few comments and criticisms 1 There are so many low cost alternatives to the Roomba iRobot has no chance at maintaining market leadership This isnt wrong only it kind of is iRobot has been stating this for literally years in their 10Ks They know it exists There are low cost alternatives that reduce the quality vs price tradeoff but this does 2 things  Creates a race to the bottom effect between low cost manufacturers thus competition grows between them just to survive This reduces overall profitability of low cost brands and removes them from the market sooner  Hurts the robovac industry short term as people purchase these low quality products realize theyre not super effective and decide to just stick with a regular vacuum in the future 2 IRBT has failed to capitalize on their technology or to expand First of all they lead the market in their technology and I dont mean ahead of the aforementioned discount brands I mean against Samsung Shark and other major players in the household cleaning industry that have been established for years They are specialists through and through Their process is slow and deliberate and thats exactly why theyll maintain their market edge Admittedly this is exactly what frustrates investors the lack of perceived growth in a time when every other techcentric consumer good is gaining momentum and I love iRobot for this3    IRBT stock price hasnt really moved much If youre investing based on stock price movement youre not investing at all But since I know thats not helpful fine the price has about tripled in the last 5 yearsAlright I admit that the above Bear case was only used to illustrate some rebuttals to common arguments against IRBT Its important to consider that just because I disagree with the arguments above doesnt mean that the rest of the market does as well Public sentiment is always a factor when considering investments and I realize that right now Im betting against the above arguments Below I will get further into some of my subjective analysis that further defends this thesisMetrics1 PE of 16 I know everyone is hating on the PE ratio lately but its still a valuable indicator of a companys performance whether we like it or not Ok so a PE of 16 is reasonable at least especially considering todays current max market PE or Sharpe ratio But thats not even why Im mentioning it If we exclude last years COVID crisis effect on the market iRobots PE ratio has never ever been this low Now thats not to say it cant go lower but I dont think Ive ever seen a strong high functioning company been as undervalued compared to itself as iRobot is right now MacroTrends2 PEG ratio as a result of the above is an absurd 89 if dividing PE by the projected next 5 years of earnings growth Whats great about this is that thats a low end estimate for earnings growth IRBT saw an earnings growth of 73 over the TTM is projected for a 62 EPS growth over the coming year and even their past 5 years show a 285 EPS growth Dividing the PE by any of those numbers makes the undervaluation theory even stronger Its absurd how undervalued this is right now Finviz3 Debt Zero debt but I did want to mention this for a specific reason When a company lacks any debt its perceived that growth is limited if financial leverage isnt being used This is understandable but I think that iRobot has found a middle ground between funding new projects with their own cash and maintaining a ridiculously healthy balance sheet4 Other Basics Revenue gross revenue and Cash Flow from Operations has continued to climb steadily year after year Their product lineup might not be growing but they sure as Heck are growing stronger financially over time Also their entire cash position outweighs their entire Liabilities column on the Balance Sheet how can you not love that5 Institutional Ownership is 100 Theres no real room here This shows confidence in the company but prevents major moves upward by a new big interested buyer to jump the price significantly It also brings along the potential risk of a major move down if an Institution decides it wants to pull out What compounds this issue is that theres only about 28 million shares of iRobot to go around and while they have issued buybacks to reduce this amount which is good for investors it can also be very scary during tumultuous times Subjective analysis I love but had the concern going into this that the company hasnt grown in a few years After looking through their financial statements Ive been proven wrong As a matter of fact theyve proven me wrong time and time again when trying to find cracks in the armor I was hoping that perception of their product lineup was poor its not Even with Samsung being in the same market as them since 2014 Roomba has crushed their competition and its partly because the customer base believes in them I then turned my attention to employee sentiment that too was a dead end Glassdoor shows raves reviews for iRobot People like working thereWarren Buffett has saidyes I know the entirety of reddit quotes him but today this is extra applicable to this thesis that there might be a thousand people who dont agree with your investing opinion and thats fine As it stands now I dont think many people perceive iRobot as a company with the growth momentum of a rocket ship Putting myself in the perspective of a business owner which is what you become the moment you hit the Place Buy Order button has made me realize that I would love to own this business Its a profitable leader in a market segment that has the ability to expand further into the quickly growing tech and robotics industries but doesnt rely on them So if the haters hate then let them hate and

stock Preferred stock Treasury stock Retained earningsIf  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns the  assets  and subtract all of the claims from third parties the  liabilities  the residual leftover is the owners equity Dueling ViewsRecord of capital invested  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assetsinplace  ie the assets that allow for its current operations to occurMeasure of current value  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants or at least accounting rule writers that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business todayLiquidation value  There is a third school with lenders to the firm among its primary  members who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm if you liquidated them today Fixed and Current AssetsThe Old Way Two or three decades ago the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at original cost net of accounting depreciationThe New Way As accounting has increasingly adopted the fair value standard there has been a move to mark assets to current market valueDivergent Effects The difference in values that you get for assets using the two approaches varies It is Greater on older assets than on newer ones Greater on fixed assets than current assets Financial Assets Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies private or public With  holdings of publicly traded securities the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete With equity ownership in other companies the rules can vary depending on    Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake 50 or a minority stake  The former will lead to full consolidation where 100 of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent companys financials with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or noncontrolling interest on the liability side and with  the latter the actual stake will be shown as an asset    With  a minority stake whether it is held for trading or as a longterm  investment With the former the holding will be marked to market With  the latter it will be shown at book value terms Intangible AssetsBig game  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets and  from that talk you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles brand name management quality etcBut different reality  In reality accountants are much better at valuing smallbore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles Goodwill After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item goodwill Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little    For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet a company has to do an acquisition    When that acquisition occurs goodwill is measured as the difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target companys asset value dressed up book value    It shows up as an asset because without it in place balance sheets would not balance Goodwill ImpairmentOld rules  For much of the last century goodwill once created in an acquisition  was written off on autopilot often amortized over long periods in equal  installmentsNew Rules In the late 1990s both GAAP and IFRS  rewrote the rules requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not To make that judgment accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged or decreased and goodwill  would be impairedIs it informational  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements in the sector and lag them by months and sometimes  years the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible Current LiabilitiesCurrent liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups Noninterestbearing liabilities such as accounts payable and supplier credit which represent part of normal operations Interestbearing shortterm borrowings such as commercial paper short term debt and the short term portion 1 year of long term debt Deferred salaries taxes and other amounts due in the short termWhen  computing noncash working capital we do not include interestbearing  short term debt in the calculation moving it instead into the debt  column Debt DueWhen companies borrow money it can take three forms1 Corporate bonds represent debt raised from public markets2 Bank loans debt raised from banks and other lending institutions3 Lease debt  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years Until 2019 only leases classified as capital leases qualified  but since 2019 operating lease commitments are also debtThe marktomarket movement on the asset side of the balance sheet has been muted on the liability  side of the balance sheet Bank debt for the most part is recorded as  originally borrowed and corporate bonds due are for the most part not  marked to market Debt detailsWhile  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due broken down  into current and long term there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes for most companiesThis additional information can be on three fronts1 Individual debt due with stated interest rates and maturities2 Additional features on the debt including floatingfixed and straightconvertible provisions3 A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due by year Shareholders

       " array(['Preamble The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legalityethical aspects of this what I wanted to know isDid Congress members beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made publicWhere is the data from senatestockwatchercomMassive shoutout to urambat1994httpswwwredditcomurambat1994 for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public The website has data of Congress trading from 2019 While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site given that we have more than 9K trades to work with I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective Also please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their tradesWhile Congress members are supposed to report the transaction within 30 dayshttpswwwcitizenorgarticlepersonalfinancialdisclosurerequirementsforpublicofficials the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediatelyAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the endAnalysisA total of 9676 trades were made by the members in the past two years This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself Out of the 4911 Buys what I am really interested in is the 1375 transactions which were over 15K I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions 5K to affect the analysis The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10 of their annual salary into one trade they should be very confident about the stock I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarilyResults For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against SP500 returns during the same perioda One Monthb One Quarterc Till Date From the date of purchase to TodayReturns made by the CongressAvg Return Change in Price Change in SPYChange over SPYOne Month255242012One Quarter876742134Till Date32402640599At this point it should not come as a surprise but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods But what I am really interested in is if its possible to follow their trades after disclosure after a time lag of 30 days and still beat the benchmarkReturns if you followed their trades after the disclosureAvg Return Change in Price Change in SPYChange over SPYOne Month20248048One Quarter1046789257Till Date29622373589If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure you would beat SP500 over the long run My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden shortterm gains can put a spotlight on their trades This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profitLimitations of analysis There are multiple limitations to the analysis1 The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run So the results might change in a market downturnrecession2 The data has been sourced from senatestockwatchercom as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them you can find it in the google sheet I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress3 There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress The disclosure is always in ranges eg 100k  200k So for calculating the investment amount I have taken the average of the given rangeConclusionThis analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stockpicking capability is something that cant be proven from the data and is left to the readers judgment I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysisWhichever side of the political spectrum you leanto the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their tradesLink to Google Sheet

with the company gapping up more than 100 today up roughly 255 in the week 570 for the month AMC now has a larger market cap roughly 30 billion than Gamestop GME ever did at the height of its rally In other news market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports The monthlong battle between shortsellers and retail investors took another drastic turn with AMC rocketing up reaching as high as 7262 and overtaking Gamestop GME in terms of market cap This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining Shares of other socalled meme stocks that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday Bed Bath  Beyond BBBY gained more than 60 while Naked Brand Group NAKD and BlackBerry BB were up 28 and 30 respectively Shares of Gamestop GME were up roughly 13New economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain The Institute of Supply Managements headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages The report found that companies and their suppliers continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand noting that record lead times wide scale shortages of critical basic materials rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices The ISMs headline index registered a reading of 612 in May an increase from Aprils reading of 607 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster readings below indicating contraction However its important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved And as supply starts to meet demand the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down  In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the nearterm In an April 28 meeting Jerome Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businessesLooking ahead market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report which will be released this Friday This report will highlight the state of economic recovery showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report Importantly the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal at which point monetary support will begin to taper Highlights The US said Wednesday it will impose tariffs on the UK and five other countries in response to their taxes on US technology companies but will suspend the levies for six months as it seeks to negotiate an international resolution Tesla Inc is recalling nearly 6000 US vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose with the potential to cause a loss of tire pressure documents made public on Wednesday show Twitter Inc said Tuesday it will begin testing ads on its disappearing posts feature called Fleets as it works to offer more options for advertisers The company previously said it set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023 from last years levels which it plans to achieve in part by selling ads on more parts of its site and mobile app Late last week President Joe Biden unveiled a 6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022 which would include a number of

Obviously this is not always the case and I think when it comes to things like Covid and stuff its best just to follow the restrictions and what not  But immunology is deeply rooted in science and is easily testableI have a degree in economics so Im not one to sling the profession through the mud  But I think that some economists are attempting to bring a degree to certainty to the field that simply is not realistic  FA Hayek talked about this  Economist William White who predicted the 08 crash also talked about this  Im not the only one saying itI recently read in a book The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruis Zafn a passage that struck me  I will provide the original text in Spanish for those who speak it as his words are far more beautiful than my subpar translationEra un buen lector de la historia y saba que el futuro se lea en las calles las factoras y los cuarteles con ms claridad que en la prensa de la maanaHe had a good read on the future and he knew that the future was better foretold in the streets in the factories and in the troop quarters than in the morning newsx200BThe 08 CrisisWhen the real estate bubble burst in 06 and the financial system came toppling down in 0708 economists and central bankers were left scratching their head  They would eventually say that it was impossible to see this coming but in the Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission reporthttpswwwgovinfogovcontentpkgGPOFCICpdfGPOFCICpdf they debunked this and said that there was plenty of warningPeople on the ground at mortgage originator firms saw it coming  Consumer advocacy groups saw it coming  People at ratings agencies saw it coming  But at all levels they were ignored  There was an assumption that somehow via technology and financial engineering we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigmBut Michael J Burry saw it coming  He was a bit of an outsider and its no surprise to me that he would be the one to take a wider look at things and say wait a minutePeter Schiff saw it coming  I have mixed feelings about him as he has strong and oftentimes incorrect IMO political views  But what I like about Schiff is that he doesnt pull any punches  He didnt buy it when Bernanke said subprime is contained  A lot of people did  The market didx200B2021  Anecdotes from the groundMy mom traded in her car yesterday and she told me she was surprised that the were willing to give her 11000 for it  It wasnt in bad condition but this amount was surprisingly high to both of my parentsShe told me that a year or so ago they took the car into the shop because it was making a funny noise  They paid a lot of money to have it checked out but no problem or solution was found  My mom mentioned this to the people at the dealership and they even took it for a test drive  No problem  They were willing to give her the full 11000 no more questions askedTo me this looks like speculative behavior  Used car prices are going through the roof due to not only decreased supply but more importantly to increased demand with so much free money sloshing around in the system And since prices keep going up and up the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it regardless of the state it was in  Sound familiarHow about Warren Buffet saying hes seeing massive price increases all across the boardWhat about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub Look at the meme stocks  Look at Archegos  Look at Tesla  Speculation is running rampant right now  Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say lets not overcomplicate it its goin north  Ie the trend is up right now so its going to keep going up  What in the world kind of analysis is thatIn addition the SP 500 hasnt had a serious downturn since 2008 remember stocks always go up right  Covid doesnt count  It barely scratched the market and the rebound has been insaneI follow a channel on YouTube called Everything Money highly recommended this sub wont let me link it  The main analyst Paul has been investing since just before the dotcom bubble  He knows that its NOT normal for stocks to always go up  This guy isnt an economist  Hes not a new investor  Hes not some pundit  Hes an investor who has been battletested  Hes a guy on the ground  He knows this isnt normalx200BThe Stubbornness of Ineffective ParadigmsIn my own job as an Englishasaforeignlanguage teacher I have seen how many teachers stubbornly cling to ineffective methods that dont work  I had one friend today tell me that this is coming from a place of ignorance but I dont think their method of focusing on grammar works I told him in this case your ignorance is more insightful than their expert methodology  He is correct as my best students are those who do less grammar and have more exposure to real EnglishIt is the teachers who think they have to micromanage their students learning who simply end up getting in the way  We cant engineer the ability to speak a foreign language all we can do is provide contact to it and just like a baby learning their native tongue eventually it starts happening  Yet teachers cling to the false notion that it is through their deliberate efforts that students will learnAnd if such an ineffective paradigm can persist so stubbornly in this environment why not in others  How about the war on drugs  Can we simply force people to stop taking drugs  Does it make any sense  No  But people dont like to change their views  they cling to them  And I believe economists the Fed and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market and as long as we make the right adjustments via QE and fiscal policy we will be OKFA Hayek would call this the pretense of knowledgex200BConclusionI dont know whats going to happen and hey I could be wrong  Maybe stocks will always go up and well just avoid any major crises from here on out  It could happenThe issue is that the bulls and the central bankers never even seem to posit the idea that hey I could be wrong  To them its science  Physics  Math  Thats the economy thats the marketBut the market is not science  We can do our best to try and understand it but IMO part of having a true understanding of it is realizing that we will never be able to figure it out entirely and then planning our policies in such a way that takes into account our limitationsIm predicting that this situation is not sustainable and Im predicting that we are going to see some sort of crisis in some ways comparable to 2008  I believe that ultraeasy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis  I also believe that inflation will be a problem and perhaps a serious oneIm not shorting anything because I recognize that I could be wrong  Im still learning and developing my theory every day  But I am playing things very very conservativelyI am going to take the step to post this because by taking a position I will either learn through being correct or learn by being proven wrong   The worst thing anyone can do is take no position at all and neither succeed nor fail at anything and thus guarantee that they never learn or advance in any way whatsoeverGood luck to everyone',\n",

       " array(['What does Alibaba doFirst and foremost they are an online commerce platform They sell retail they sell wholesale they sell single items they sell container loads of items This also includes a logistics platform and global fulfillment network Cainiao Network and an ondemand delivery and services platform Eleme Then they also have a rapidly expanding cloud business in addition to some small entertainment gaming and other business units but in this analysis Ill mainly focus on the online commerce and the cloud business as they are the two pillars of Alibabas business strategySo lets look at the online commerce Is it doing well Well Its doing fantastic The last year it grew by 35 YoY Over the last 5 years online commerce sales increased by almost 500 from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020 To give you an idea 1 US dollar was roughly 708 RMB then so Alibabas online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly 615 Billion Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing In fact this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is Then the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22 to 165 billion RMB or 234 billion So how are they doing THAT well Simple They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020 They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users Essentially theyve got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINEDSo Alibabas online marketplaces include several websites but not just any websites In fact the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN THE WORLD Tmall and Taobao Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place The company presence is just mindboggling And to top it all off the business model is much lighter than Amazons for example Why Well Alibaba does not sell its own products it doesnt have any inventory doesnt have any warehouses which results in less expenses and a higher net profit How much higher Well Amazons latest net profit margin is 553 Alibabas 2471So the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibabas amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings In fact the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform Now the cloud computing is different In the 4th quarter of 2020 it finally broke even It is an important part of Alibabas longterm strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it In 2020 cloud revenues grew by almost 62 Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that wayOverall the company is growing fast roughly 38 increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70 in the last year We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well How are its financials though Well it has a lot of cash roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy In fact theyve got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares In the final quarter of 2020 they repurchased roughly 110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly but theyve approved a share repurchase plan of between 6 and 10 Billion If we see them acting on that plan investors could get very excitedSo the business is growing fast the financials look solid theyre starting to return money to the shareholders What about their priceWell the company is relatively cheap right now Their PE ratio is 255 with a forward PE of 206 Historically they have a PE average of 345 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so theres that Compared to their direct Chinese competitors Alibabas PE isnt actually that low but Id say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business Also if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments we can see that Amazons PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 1372 way higher than Alibaba Amazons PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibabas Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020But theyve also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them Basically we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal at least in my opinionIts no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY Yahoo finance screenshot Also most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them Its got better sales better net profit margin better brand presence better longterm strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo Vipshop JD Clearly its the better deal at least in my opinion but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20 of his Daily Journal portfolioNow this stock just looks to good to be true right Sort of Alibaba does have some issues but theyre of slightly different nature The main risks involved with the company are more political First of all you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military that dont provide proper financial statements and reporting that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government Now technically speaking just because a company is delisted doesnt mean that you cannot trade it but chances are that its stock price will be hurt A LOT Youd still be able to trade it overthecounter but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers wont support it I know that my broker eToro does not Still you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibabas stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange The ticker is 9988 but its essentially the same stock Personally I dont think thats going to happen but dont take my word for it Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delistingThat isnt all though Currently there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma its founder made criticised the Chinese governments approach to financial regulations As a result the IPO for Ant Group which is essentially Alibabas spinoff that deals with consumer financing and lending was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered More recently more regulations and restructuring was ordered While this has affected Alibabas business model to an extent the regulations have also affected Alibabas direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of 28 BILLION US dollars the biggest one ever handed so far They also ordered the company to stop its anticompetitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms So are the regulators finished with Alibaba Well we can only speculate The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies but as I said this is not something that you can know for certainSo whats the verdict Is Alibaba a good investment right now Personally I think so It is undoubtedly risky but the company offers such amazing prospects that its just crazy to miss out on I mean if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price wouldnt you Id recommend doing your own research into it but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and thats why it is my second largest holding and almost 10 of my total portfolioFinally Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectoryThats my analysis on Alibaba Theres a lot more to talk about but I wanted to keep it on the short side What do you thinkx200BTLDR Alibaba is solid and cheap Check the comments for a video link',\n",

out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year That is absolutely nuts That is a profit margin that went from 24 to 66 that is not normal either but we arent done lets look at the

significant increase in profit margin 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts  in 3 of these cases the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about while the remaining company looks like theyre geniuses for the growth they had All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition  Although Selling GA is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted The growth they experienced Id say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business This makes sense But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year its a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they dont want to lower them because they see how much more money theyre making Everything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons Let me know what you think in the comments This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future Thank you',\n",

Harvesthttpswwwinvestopediacomarticlestaxes08taxlossharvestingasp   even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had   losses thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions       This may not be totally accurate as the manager may be doing some of this but you dont have the choice of when he sells only when you do    You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you dont want to support    Due   to the way the index works any large stock that becomes part of the   index is potentially a huge drag on the index This happened when Tesla   was going to be added on 12212020 which was announced on 11162020   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price   which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the   stock If you think it sounds kind of circular thats because it is       Funds can attempt to counter this with some complex financial tools but that doesnt mean they are successful For most people it is impossible to time the market effectively Tons of us seem to be able to buy at the peak no problem Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them The markets are relatively efficient over the longterm Companies   with strong financials a competitive advantage good management a   sustainable business model etc tend to do better than companies   missing one or more of those attributes over the longterm Tech   seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes I dont see this necessarily as a problem In my mind the digital landscape is infinite   compared to the physical worlds finite space With more tech being   found in every day devices the advancement of Industry 40httpswwwibmcomtopicsindustry40 and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion HypothesisUsing industry bench marking against the best companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well   diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the   SP 500 Industry Classification For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared    This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology Communication Services Utilities etc    This   seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other   that arent really accurate comparisons See the example on ROE below So for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks    This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Subindustry    This was successful on 98 of the stocks and for the final 2 I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the Global Industry Classification StandardhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiGlobalIndustryClassificationStandard    I   ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further  Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less  than 10  parts  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes This will  likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical  issues dealing  with averagesmedians that were negative There were  also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they  could be combined Experiment 2020750   stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry Stocks  were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the   industry index For example each companies average ROE of the last 4   years was compared to this index value with the following type of   breakdown ROE  Index ROE  Poor  1 ROE  Index ROE  Good  2 ROE  150 of Index ROE  Great  3For   example the ROE communication services industry index value used was   1010 If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9   they would receive a poor rating If they had a ROE of 105 they would   receive a good rating If they had a ROE of 25 they would receive a   great ratingThis was done for all of the metrics below ROE Revenue Growth  EBITDA  FCF The   relative

then analyzed to see if it was declining and if so it too was eliminatedThis   left 45 stocks These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly What did the   company do What were their competitive advantages Are they currently   in any lawsuits Does their debt look out of control Do I see them   being a longterm sustainable choice Is their IP about to expire   Essentially boiling down to Is there any reason that I want to exclude   themThat left 26 across 7 sectors httpsimgurcomaNsBdPtbhttpsimgurcomaNsBdPtbThese   26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020 August 2020 and   September 2020

returnsFor   those wondering how the exclusions did they were only tracked against   the first July purchase but that comparison to date including   dividends for July purchase only would be MATH INDEX return of 3924 Exclusions return of 3375 VFIAX return of 3005Overall after 10 months we have 2 excellent results1 The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the SP 5002 The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 55This is obviously a short period Can we do it again this year Should we go bigger Yes Experiment 20212850   tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list   The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics Revenue Growth   shows growth rate of the company Profit Margin  shows how effective the business is at making money Operating Margin  shows how much money the company earns on its revenue FCF Margin  shows how efficient a company is with their cash EBITDA Margin  shows a companies operating profitability ROE  shows how well management balances profits leverage and assets to make money ROA  shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits ROIC  shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns DebtEquity Ratio  shows the financial stability of a companyMore   metrics were used due to the increased data set These stocks were  then  grouped by industry and the average of the averages is taken to   determine the industry average for the last 5 years I switched to   median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of   the metrics If that was confusing here is an example 3   stocks that make up an industry averaged 10 15 and 20 ROE over   the last 5 years The median over the last 5 years for that industry is   then 15 and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmarkEach   stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics and given a score 1Poor 2Good 3Great as well as a composite   score out of 27 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average I measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as previously performed Poor  100 Good  150   Great  150 Again these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular metric to find a useful distributionI   also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the  metrics  and overall For those wondering the best stock in this  ranking was  CORT with a score of 2097 and the worst was CYCN with a  score of  23095 Because the overall rank is a combination of 9  categories with  values ranging from 12791 the theoretical best a  company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could  do would be 25119  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesnt  match the original  input is primarily due to mergersacquisitions or  the stock being taken  private Another stock was acquired during the  analysis changing the  max number yet againHere is an example showing Aerospace  Defense scoring httpsimgurcomafKDYNXEhttpsimgurcomafKDYNXEHere is an example showing growth

scored a 25 26 or 27 on the composite or any stock that had a   high enough overall rank to justify being reviewedNext   I read the description of 300 stocks and looked through their   financials for any inconsistencies such as one huge year throwing off   their average profit margins higher than operating margins highly   leveraged companies with poor growth etc My favorite find was that   Chemed Corporation provides hospicepalliative care and owns   RotoRooter Yes I did end up keeping them no there are not great   synergies between the sectors of the business yes they are aware of   this I also eliminated industries I wasnt interested in reviewing   such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO Oil   and Gas because its oil and gas etc These activities eliminated   150 I would like to get back to REITs but Id need to build a   separate modelI then looked at   each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut Are   all the rest of them in the double digits for growth are the profit   margins substantially less which one is in a better debt situation   etc Who deserves to be on this list This eliminated 75We   were down to 84 stocks at this point I then attempted to look at each   companys investor presentation annual report etc to better   understand what the company does their revenue model risks etc I was   not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last year   just due to the substantial increase in companies 26 vs 84 I only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83 companies   across 31 industries Breakdown here httpsimgurcoma8P9dmd9httpsimgurcoma8P9dmd9I then purchased all of these in equal proportion a few days ago AAON AAPL ACN ADBE AEIS ALGN AMAT ANET APH ATR ATVI AX BLD CDNS

amount of the heavy lifting still occurs with individual analysis this would be pretty much impossible Creating a model based off past results may also provide a bias that Im not sure Id be immune to

companyx200BhttpspostimgccR3BJ4Ln6httpspostimgccR3BJ4Ln6    Gaming has eclipsed movies music and booksx200BIn simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising subscriptions merchandise and content licensing As such its not not video games developer or publisher It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businessesx200BhttpspostimgcchzQgfHm2httpspostimgcchzQgfHm2    Image visualizing Enthusiast Gaming overall structurex200BCurrently the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content Destructoid The escapist Nintendo Enthusiasts etc YouTube channels with a combined 24 million subscribers Wisecrack The Squad The Count Down etc  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming influencers across  many different social media platforms and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events preCOVID 19 Taken together its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis Enthusiasts esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite Apex Legends and a variety of other games The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the 1 bil esports marketx200BhttpspostimgccpmddPcs6httpspostimgccpmddPcs6    Slide showcasing owned assetsx200B65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the US  alone This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization  US eyes are traditionally those that have the highest value Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming This is an important  demographic since it is one of the hardesttoreach ones and is one  the demographics that spends the most on nonessential goods and has a  larger lifetime value since they are in the early stages of their  lives The CEO mentions how 70 of the companys audience is either Gen Z or Millennials with 65 of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming 67 of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach an astounding 48 of Enthusiast Gamings audience do not use Facebook Altogether the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming yearsToday Enthusiast  has 110k subscribers mostly from The Sims Resource and this number is up 50 YTD generating slightly less than 2mil in revenue per  quarter While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource Escapist and Siliconera they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these propertiesx200BTheres a much bigger play that we can offer customers and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it Thats our approach  because nobody can offer the things that we can offer And so we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offerx200BAs one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team its only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space In the future esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today in my opinion as 60 of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports Today Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsungs OTT service and there should be more deals done in the next few yearsAfter all these monetization streams Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through ecommerce and social networking However since this  is still several years out management has not given much detail on  thisx200BAnd then down the road we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace as well as developing a social network which were  pretty excited aboutx200BhttpspostimgcchXK2vTmwhttpspostimgcchXK2vTmw    Companys growth and monetization strategyx200BIn addition recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem

original contentOverall gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is wellpositioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world  In addition the

opened 173 down but managed to close the day 012 up Despite the market declining modestly the last three days it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks As said before I thought the initial selloff after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this weeks price action  Leadership in equity markets has seesawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pickup in activity may generate a surge in inflation After leading the market higher in April in the last month the Nasdaq is down 477 compared to 079 down in the SP 500 In my view this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes basically a written record of what happened in the meeting which said that participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committees maximumemployment and pricestability goals and reiterated for like the millionth time that they did not believe a nearterm adjustment of monetary policy was needed Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down Read the entire meeting minutes herehttpswwwfederalreservegovmonetarypolicyfilesfomcminutes20210428pdfHowever it is important to note the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report which came in much weaker than expected which bolsters the Feds argument that employment remains far from their goal and the Consumer Price Index which showed a greaterthanexpected increase in consumer prices That said the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Feds view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be transitory and want to see a string of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are consideredAs the US economy reopens we are seeing a surge in consumer spending we saw a 108 increase in spending in March supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up inflation is expected to slow down In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitory In an April 28 meeting Jerome Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Moreover it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not Finally the April Job Report which showed the economy gained only 266000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy Highlights After declining in recent weeks the selloff in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified with Bitcoin BTC falling below 40000 after the People Bank of China PBOC doubled down on its stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldnt be used for transactions The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account Virtual

steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks As I have said before I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index where technology stocks sank and the SP 500 SPY fell 4 was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below Last week the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes which showed a larger increase than expected  The CPI which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs rose 42 from a year ago compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 36 increase The monthly gain was 08 against the expected 02 Excluding the volatile food and energy prices the core CPI this is the main measure of inflation increased 3 compared to the same period in 2020 and 09 on a monthly basis The respective estimates were 23 and 03 The PPI which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 62 compared to April 2020 and 06 monthly increase The core PPI which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 46 year over year and 07 in April Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 03 monthly increase in April and 38 year over yearWhile its difficult to pinpoint exact causes there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market  First after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials limiting production capability and driving up delivery time and as a result driving up prices As basic economics shows us when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities aka supply prices inevitably go up One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits Federal debtincurred when the government sells Treasury bonds bills notes and other securities to cover its costsrecently hit an alltime high However policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels Jerome Powell said Given the low level of interest rates theres no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview saying Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected longterm bond yields declined indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserves commitment to move slowly when raising ratesNow that we understand why inflation may be rising these are the reasons I think fears are overblown With the US economy reopening we are seeing a surge in consumer spending we saw a 108 increase in spending in March supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up inflation is expected to slow down In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitory In an April 28 meeting Jerome Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Moreover it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not Finally the April Job Report which showed the economy gained only 266000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy Highlights The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown  In a Ford factory in Michigan President Biden promoted his 174 billion plan to promote and accelerate

       " array(['PsychoMarket Recap  Friday May 28 2021Stocks gained on Friday with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending income and inflation and a strong Weekly unemployment report The market has made a remarkable recovery particularly in technology after the market tumbled 4 following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago In my view as I have said for weeks the recovery in the market confirms that the initial selloff driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblownNew government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April but still pulled back after Marchs stimulusfueled surge Personal income fell by 131 in April compared to March less than the 142 drop expected This follows a 209 increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of 1400 stimulus checks to most Americans In another report the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 31 in April from a year earlier blowing past the Feds traditional 2 target Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemics grip eases thanks to vaccinations and will have no impact on monetary policy Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory Supplychain constraints combined labor shortages in certain industries and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirusinduced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings These are all factors that are widely considered transitory meaning not permanent In an April 28 statement Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said An episode of onetime price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent yearoveryear inflation into the future Clogged supplychains wont affect Federal Reserve policy because theyre temporary and expected to resolve themselves Moreover he said For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up that would take some time and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen In other words Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesnt expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improvesIn remarks this week members of the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program In separate comments Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation Richard Clarida Vice Chairman of the Fed offered a slightly different view but one that is inline with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past Clarida said there will come a time in upcoming meetings when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that it is going to depend on the flow of data The Fed is currently buying 120 billion a month in governmentissued and governmentbacked securities and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recoveredThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will as they have said time and again wait for concrete data before any considerations are made This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14 which proves market participants shouldnt worry about quantitative easing tapering in my opinion Powell said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidanceThe Department of Labors Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemicera low an encouraging sign that

difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action but I think there are two main competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so It seems that fears inflation marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March bolsters confidence in the Feds claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a string of strong labor reports Again though with so many factors revolving around the market it is difficult to see the clear pictureThe SP 500 SPY closed the day 117 up after closing 209 down yesterday The techheavy Nasdaq QQQ closed 077 up after closing 254 down yesterday The Dow Jones DIA closed 126 up after closing 2 down yesterday Yesterday the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index CPI which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs rose 42 from a year ago compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 36 increase The monthly gain was 08 against the expected 02 Excluding the volatile food and energy prices the core CPI this is the main measure of inflation increased 3 compared to the same period in 2020 and 09 on a monthly basis The respective estimates were 23 and 03 Today the producer price index PPI which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 62 compared to April 2020 and 06 monthly increase The core PPI which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 46 year over year and 07 in April Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 03 monthly increase in April and 38 year over year This is the biggest jump since 2014 In tandem with the CPI report this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected However while the readings in inflation definitely are not good it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before In an April 28 meeting Powell said Amid progress on

Federal Reserve including Powell have consistently reiterated they want to see a   String of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy Talking about the March Job

Also many people are becoming more aware of the additives that are in the foods that they eat and the environmental problems that come with meat products All of these factors make Beyond Meat products appealing as not only do people enjoy knowing they are eating healthy but they can do their part toward slowing down environmental problems While the plantbased market may not be the largest Beyond Meat said they are going after the global meat industry The global meat industry is valued at 12 trillion and had a CAGR of 24 between 2015 and 2019 Perhaps the biggest discrepancy between these two industries besides how the various products are made and consist of is price Beyond Meats Beyond Sausage sells for 1030 a pound that is about 70 more than regular pork sausage One pound of factoryfarmed beef burgers at Walmart run somewhere around 3pound while one pound of Beyond Meats Beef Burger will run you around 625pound While the difference in pricing is certainly a lot that doesnt mean that people dont buy Beyond Meat products Going forward well have to see how much of a disrupter this company is to the global meat marketRecent DevelopmentsAcquisitionsThe new Beyond Burger launches at grocery stores nationwide April 27 2021  Beyond Meat recently introduced their new Beyond Burger which has 35 less fat and saturated fat and fewer calories than 8020 beef This new iteration will hit grocery store shelves beginning the week of May 3rd It will be available in a 2pack the brands first ever value 4pack and a 1lb Beyond Beef pack Dariush Ajami the Chief Innovation Officer at Beyond Meat said  We are continuously working on understanding beef flavor at a deeper level to ensure our plantbased beef platform delivers a delicious and satisfying sensory experience The new Beyond Burgers rich flavor profile resembles that of ground beef and extensive testing with our consumers validated this new flavor direction with likeability scoring onpar with 8020 ground beef burgers According to the University of Michigans 2018 Life Cycle Assessment when compared to traditional 8020 beef burgers the Beyond Burger has 99 less impact on water scarcity 93 less impact on land use requires 46 less energy and generates 90 fewer greenhouse gas emissionsBeyond Meat announces major retail expansions throughout Europe April 12 2021  Beyond Meat announced that they will be significantly increasing product distribution within thousands of European locations The plantbased foods market in Europe has seen sales grow by 49 over the last two years In the UK Sainsburys said they would double their distribution of the Beyond Burger nationwide Also Waitrose launched the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage The retailers together increased Beyond Meats presence in 445 stores In Germany Beyond Meat will be expanding their product offering in over 1000 German retail stores through Kaufland Tegut Famila and Real In Austria the Beyond Meat product selection will be expanded at SPAR and BILLA locations to a total of 1500 retail stores Migros stores in Switzerland will expand Beyond Mince distribution to 155 stores Nearly 1000 Albert Heijn and Jumbo stores in the Netherlands will now offer Beyond Mince Chuck Muth the Chief Growth Officer at the company said These new and expanded retail partnerships throughout the continent serve as strong proof points that Europes appetite for plantbased meat and Beyond Meat products in particular is on the rise Moreso in June 2020 Beyond Meat announced its first comanufacturing facility in Europe in partnership with Zandbergen Worlds Finest Meats in Zoeterwoude NetherlandBeyond Meat opens manufacturing facility in China to accelerate localized production and innovation April 7 2021  Earlier last month Beyond Meat opened a new advanced manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic and Technological Development Zone located near Shanghai Ethan Brown CEO said The opening of our dedicated plantbased meat facility in China marks a significant milestone in Beyond Meats ability to effectively compete in one of the worlds largest meat markets We are committed to investing in China as a region for longterm growth and we believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plantbased proteins that are good for both people and planet Just a little over a year ago Beyond Meat entered mainland China through a nationwide partnership with Starbucks In addition to Starbucks Beyond Meat has partnered with multiple other food services such as KFC Pizza Hut Jindingxuan GangLi Beijing Slow Boat Brewery Hema METRO China and more Beyond Meat has been expanding so heavily in China that theyve even made a product specifically for the Chinese Market Beyond PorkWhat could go wrongFoodservice doesnt pick up  Beyond Meat has a number of strategic partnerships with restaurant chains in various countries In the past weve seen that whenever they announce a new partnership with a food chain their stock jumps dramatically only to fall back to where it was before a few days after Beyond Meat has partnered with the likes of Pizza Hut Taco Bell McDonalds KFC and a number of other restaurants Looking at the foodservice side of their business theyve seen tremendous YoY growth While Covid has impacted their business significantly in terms of foodservice sales many investors still remain optimistic that this side of their business will bounce back While they will likely continue seeing growth going forward I remain skeptical as to how all these strategic partnerships will play out Impossible foods is their main competitor and theyve partnered with the likes of Burger King White Castle Red Robin and others These partnerships with respect to both companies have played out well as shown by the YoY growth in foodservice revenue The questions that remain to be asked are in the longrun how many of these restaurants will create their own meat alternative products or stop doing business with Impossible foods or Beyond Meat Taco Bell has already begun testing their own plantbased protein products and how many others will follow Furthermore Beyond Meat has been relying on new partnerships to boost foodservice sales There might be a point to where the growth in foodservice revenue stops as a result of their not being worthy partnerships with restaurant chains and what happens then Nonetheless I remain optimistic for the time being that Beyond Meat will see their foodservice revenue increase rapidly for the next couple years',\n",

recovering throughout the day with the Nasdaq QQQ going from roughly 2 down at open to close to breakeven by close With the market fluctuating so wildly it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action but I think there are two main competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March bolsters the Feds argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a string of strong labor reportsLooking ahead market participants wait for the  US Bureau of Labor Statistics April consumer price index CPI set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index PPI set to be released on Thursday These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers and are expected to show a significant jump over last years pandemicdepressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens Last Friday the April Job Report showed only 266000 jobs added in the month of April missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916000 jobs added in March Despite significant progress the economy remains roughly 82 million jobs short compared to prepandemic levels and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020 For months members of the Federal Reserve including Chairman Jerome Powell have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be transitory and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy  In an April 28 meeting Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Put simply Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors transitory meaning not permanentOn the other hand market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices This in turn may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soonerthanexpected pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index CPI set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index PPI which are both expected to show a significant jump Expectations for CPI are 36 yearonyear for the headline print and 23 yearonyear for the Core Inflation Rate Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation PPI is expected to be 59 yearonyear for April If the numbers come out much higher than predicted some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future In short the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today For months Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance On the other hand if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve Highlights Prices for

       " array(['Investment Thesis for Daily Journal DJCOIntroduction  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business  It is a dying newspaper business but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuationManagement  Normally wed begin by looking at the business but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong so this will be our beginning  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger ViceChairman of Berkshire Hathaway  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for 2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President CEO CFO Treasurer  As such there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal their executive compensation is almost unheard of  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either 5000 or 0  Gerald Salzman the CEO receives a salary of 250000  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily JournalThe Business  The Daily Journal has three business segments 1 The Daily Journal Newspaper 2 Equity Investments and 3 Journal TechnologiesThe Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising ie traditional advertising found in most newspapers classified advertising trustee notice sale advertising legal notice advertising and circulation advertising  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little  The good news however is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily JournalI wont spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspapers most successful year isemimodern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes  It is possible that if another recession strikes the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong healthEquities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journals intrinsic value  Charlie Mungers investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal  We have insight into the Daily Journals American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing which was released within the last week  At this time the Daily Journal holds 197 million worth of American equities mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba  While it is not explicitly confirmed there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer  This would not appear in its 13F filings so its size cannot be confirmed however we can make an educated guess  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown however it is assumed to be be roughly 140 million  In the most recent filing the Daily Journal notes that it sold 20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA  As such we will value the BYD position at 120 though in truth it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing  Nonetheless we will assume its value is 120 million  This brings the Daily Journals equity portfolio to a value of 317 millionThe Daily Journal also has 27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at 165 million  I emphasized that they value the building because as Ill discuss below the company has some questionable accounting practices  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example they valued the buildings at 165 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings  If we increase the value of these holding to 30 million which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate this results in a total equity and asset value of 374 millionTheir liabilities consist of 60 million in deferred capital gains 0 interest a 295 million margin loan 3 interest and a 15 million mortgage 4 interest  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells typically he will move into another qualified investment  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio  The mortgage is self explanatory  Total liabilities amount to 91 millionBefore jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journals business segment I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of 414 million  As such to reach its market cap valuation assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business it has a value its just not a high value and in all honesty I dont know what a fair value is for that business the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth 131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuationJournal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process  It is a case management system built off of a central eSuites product that is then configured to meet the clients needsIt has a unique business model that results in once again an undervaluation of the company  After being awarded an RFP the company will then define the scope of the product establish servers on site and install its product and then configure it to the clients needs  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time the municipality is not billed  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journals current market valuationWhen its eSuites product goes live the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years with built in price adjustments to account for inflation  Currently Daily Journal has over 100 million in forthcoming revenue which due to their billing practices is a very highmargin revenue once billing starts  These contracts are found in the USA Australia Canada and Tasmania currently though more may have been signed and not discovered  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal as there is not a central repository to identify these contractsMoving forward the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after eSuites launches consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase and other esolutions will be integrated with eSuites to increase revenue such as epayment for fines and ticketsWhile the Journal Technologies already has 30some million in revenue this figure will increase with time  Additionally these municipalities will likely continue using the eSuite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired  Presently Journal Technologies is a 200300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above  Under this assumption the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between 483 million and 583 million meaning it is currently undervalued by 17 to 41There are a few risks that need to be mentioned  One is liquidity  The Daily Journal has a 400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor  It also has a 300 share price which while irrelevant to value will scare away many newer retail investors who invest 20 to 50 at a time  Beyond these two issues the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with longterm visions thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis  The result is that only about 5000 shares are traded on a daily basis  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch you may have to sell below the market rateThe other glaring issue is age  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business their old age means that in the coming years their leadership may cease to exist  No clear succession plan has been identified this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder  As management is a key strength within this business this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholdersLastly there is the 16 billion elephant in the room  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space  While their products are more modern and likely have better and flashier features this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes  Instead the Daily Journals practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients  While Im sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the longterm its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales has a PB of under 2 and has a PE of 35  By comparison Tyler Technologies has a PB of 8 is valued at 14x sales and has a PE of 91  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing though this rapid growth is slowing  By comparison the Daily Journal if it continues at its current growth is already a great investment  As most clients are onboarded growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investmentDisclaimer I hold shares of DJCO  I am posting this because after my research I think others could benefit from investing in this company if they agree with my above analysis AND because I want community feedback on thoughts about DJCO  My intention is to hold DJCO for a minimum of 4 years though more realistically I will hold this for a very long time since as I noted above the revenue for this company is incredibly sticky and I believe they have many avenues to increase their sales',\n",

huge digital wallet 2 in market share where you can tradebuy the fastgrowing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers You can read a very good

caseshttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentsmysz54reviewingthebearcaseonpaysafepsfehttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentsmysz54reviewingthebearcaseonpaysafepsfethe link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including discussion of bear cases so Im not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that subMost of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth As an example EVrelated stocks PLUG BLNK QS LAZR NKLA BLDP etc get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some dont even have revenue yet worth billions While this assumption may be accurate it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate Because of this predictive nature its really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop When or if it will pop is anyones guess So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk  high rewardsBut what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners If your customerspartners revenue grows its more likely than not they are using more of your products or services Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customerspartners financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start For this reason Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potentialPaysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11 The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth1 PENN Reported May 7

As you can see these Paysafes customerspartners are reporting explosive growth While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost ie Draftking However here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe These companies reported earnings before Paysafe so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow  May 11Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customers earning growth These factors will also influence Paysafes future growth1 They are a monopoly when it comes to iGamingSport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG MGM PENN SKLZ etc2 Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again Also when reopening occur more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe3 They are 2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ more on this belowFinally both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimationPaypal earning  May 5 2021  Revenue 603 billion vs 590 billion expected by Refinitiv source httpswwwcnbccom20210505paypalpyplearningsq12021htmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210505paypalpyplearningsq12021html Square earning  May 6 2021  Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts It also brought in 506 billion of revenue vs 336 billion expected by Refinitiv  source httpswwwcnbccom20210506squaresqearningsq12021htmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210506squaresqearningsq12021htmlSo I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th For those of you who dont know Paysafe they are not a small player Their transaction volume is about that of SQ 100 Billion If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple See the reddit link above for DD on valuationIn summary I think Paysafe is a low risk  high reward stock compare to other fintech Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward They got the 2nd largest digital wallet They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market I believe as a monopoly in iGamingSport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states CA TX NY FL begin to allow online sport betting This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has This is a massive high growth area and they own the space For these reason I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 10th 2021 Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210507inflationisthebigchallengeformarketsandthefedintheweekaheadhtml After Aprils disappointing jobs report market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead The tugofwar over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market after Fridays bounce more than halved the weeks losses in the SP technology sector The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266000 jobs created well below the 1 million expected The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its socalled quantitative easing bond purchases later this year The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like For now the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted oneoff report Its all about the inflation numbers Its all about the transitory nature and to what extent well see it said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group Its more relevant to the CPI monthovermonth changes If the monthovermonth gains are starting to pick up steam and were seeing 03 to 04 thats not transitory and thats a problem for the Fed Economists expect April CPI to rise 02 over March after a gain of 06 the month earlier But on a yearoveryear basis CPI is expected to look sizzling jumping 36 according to Dow Jones That compares to 26 the month earlier Excluding food and fuel CPI is expected to rise by 03 on a monthovermonth basis The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks a halfhour after the CPI print Wednesday Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan The producer price index is reported Thursday and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases Another important data point retail sales is released Friday Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by onetime stimulus checks Its like the steroid era of baseball he said Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus  Tech battleground The SP 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains The SP rose 12 to 4232 and 27 to 34777 But the technologyladen Nasdaq fell about 15 to 13752 even with Fridays 09 gain In the commodities market fears of inflation continued to build Copper futures hit a record high as did lumber futures rising 13 in the past week Corn futures rose 86 in the past week finishing at the highest level since 2013 West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2 to 6490 per barrel The 10year note yield which moves opposite price was at 155 down from 163 a week ago Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week with the SP energy sector by far the best performer up 89 Materials rose 59 followed by financials which were up 42 Industrials gained 34 But the SP technology sector slumped 05 for the week even with a 08 gain Friday I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling weve seen in the last few daysis not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names said Julian Emanuel chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG But its also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up thats where the capital gains lie he added So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 396 for taxpayers making more than 1 million Thats up from the current top rate of 20 Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill Emanuel said I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates The market is telling you that he said If you get a further move in rates thats a headwind Earnings season

ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces After struggling for most of the past couple months momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 125 compared to a 078 gain in the SP 500 The ARK Innovation ETF ARKK has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year After a 3839 gain from the March 2020 low to its high in midFebruary ARKK has fallen around 30 in the months since then For most of that time the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200DMA After a failed attempt to break above its 50DMA at the end of April it has taken a leg lower falling below its 200DMA for the first time in a year in the process While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200DMA it has found support around 105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall In other words from a technical perspective ARKK as well as some of its holdings still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months downtrends At least for the time being the group has found some respite in the move higher today  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050721ARKKpng As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately threequarters of net asset value For the most part these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year or since their market debut for those that have IPOed in the past year bolded and bordered rows in the table below with only a small handful in the red Teladoc TDOC Coinbase COIN and Iovance Biotherapeutics IOVA Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117 over the past year they have certainly been a pain trade recently Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment and relative to their 52week highs they are down 35 on average In fact of all 58 holdings there are only fourIntercontinental Exchange ICE TuSimple TSP Trimble TRMB and PACCAR PCARthat are less than 10 below their 52week highs and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings as such they are not pictured below  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050721ARKKTablepng While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP and EXACT Sciences EXAS have fallen below the longterm 200DMA Other names in the ETF broke below their 200DMA a while ago now and their charts do not look much better Stocks like Invitae NVTA Materialise MTLS and Teladoc TDOC collapsed below their longterm moving averages earlier this spring and this weeks moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels For TDOC and MTLS those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron REGN Unlike many other ARKK stocks REGN has actually been trending higher since March albeit that is in the context of a much longerterm downtrend than many other ARKK holdings Regardless that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its longterm downtrend In another move that is out of sync with its peers today it has reversed lower failing to break out from that downtrend  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050721ARKKBelow1png While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts Similar to the ETFs chart there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days For example DocuSign DOCU Iovance Biotherapeutics IOVA Palantir PLTR and Spotify SPOT are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year For others like Fate Therapeutics FATE Iridium IRDM PagerDuty PD PACCAR PCAR and Synopsis SNPS those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50DMA today Similarly Novartis NVS is attempting to move back above its 200DMA Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd SEE Over the past year the 50DMA has consistently provided reliable support After a brief dip back below in March in April it moved back above its 50DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week In order to keep track of the ARK Innovation ETFs ARKK holdings we created a custom portfolio that members can add here Please note that this does not update real time and is only based on ARKKs holdings as of 5621 As always investors should do their own research before buying or selling any securities and

talk of inflation continues to heat up one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex In our oneyear review of the market low we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery Well that trend hasnt stopped yet and as shown in the chart below on Wednesday the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads202105Blog5721apngssl1 Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE the Federal Reserves preferred measure of inflation remains to be seen but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019 while copper prices are less than 3 from their 2011 alltime highs However those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken In fact of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period To be clear we are not calling for runaway inflation In fact breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period However we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldnt be surprised to see this trend continue albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures but any persistent impact is likely to be modest Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday as we examine the April CPI data release  April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations Investors betting on a continued acceleration in US payrolls in April following Marchs impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be monthtomonth The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning revealing that the domestic economy added only 266000 jobs in April well below Bloombergsurveyed economists median forecast for a gain of 1000000 The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78000 jobs The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 61 from 6 though that was paired with an aboveestimate gain in the labor force participation rate which moved from 615 to 617 equaling a recovery high Average hourly earnings rose 07 month over month signaling lowerwage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way There are a few explanations for why this might be Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work Additionally stillclosed schools and lack of childcare may make it difficult for workers to return to the inperson segments of the labor markets And finally Marchs big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships such as furloughed employees Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous and timeconsuming vetting process As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low Total payrolls still sit about 82 million below the February 2020 peak of 1525 million but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lions share of those losses quickly despite todays disappointing readout  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021055721BlogCHartpngssl1 The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick While we always caution against reading too far into one data release we think most of the cited factors that suppressed Aprils payroll number should wear off naturally with time We believe that despite Aprils speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months Improving employment trendsthough choppybuoy consumer strength and the economy overall given consumers large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product GDP As such we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends where appropriate including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn  Lets Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes Our new Constitution is now established everything seems to promise it will be durable but in this world nothing is certain except death and taxes Benjamin Franklin First off we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market Weve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthythough probably not until 2022 It is worth noting though that stocks havent been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR With proposals for the 18 trillion American Families Plan AFP and 2 trillion plus infrastructure bill known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending Lets be clear though with a 5050 Senate Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties and historically slim Democratic majority in the House we think these final numbers will likely come in less than 3 trillion combined as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 396 from 37 and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than 1 million to a maximum of 434 from the current 238 Fun stat only 032 of the population makes more than 1 million a year so the truth is this wont impact the other 9968 of the population Weve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldnt be a surprise to anyone at this point explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick Now heres the catch looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy stocks did just fine Given the strong economic outlook this year youd have to think history could repeat once again As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day in 1986 and 2013 capital gains taxes increased but the economy was on firm footing back then compared with the 1970s hikes which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth Not surprisingly the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance while the 1970s hikes didnt Is it as simple as how the economy is doing It very well could be  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi2wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021055521BlogChart1pngssl1 Corporate taxes are currently 21 and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28 Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25 the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming which could knock a few percentage points off of future SP 500 Index earnings growth So what happens after corporate taxes are raised As the table below shows muted returns a year out are normal but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase suggesting investors werent very worried about higher taxes on the horizon  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021055521BlogChart2pngssl1 Its always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year theres not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome The picture is murkier though with corporate taxes which isnt surprising since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth But is often happens markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces  Individuals Writers and Managers All Still Bullish The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1 The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3 Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 17 percentage points to 443 While not a particularly large increase this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIIBullpng With bullish sentiment higher fewer respondents reported as bearish Only 231 of investors reported pessimistic sentiment down 26 percentage points versus last weeks reading Just like bullish sentiment that was not a particularly large change and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks range  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIIBearpng The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bullbear spread climbing 43 points to 212 While that is still at the high end of the past few years range it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers the bullbear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago In other words sentiment has moderated recently but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIIBullBearpng Perhaps the most notable reading in this weeks AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment Up 07 percentage points from the prior week it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 52 percentage point gains the previous two weeks Regardless moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March Other than that week and the current one there has only been one other week in the past year second to last week of 2020 in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now Even though this weeks reading is elevated relative to the past year compared to the rest of the history of the survey it is pretty unremarkable On average over the life of the survey neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 09 percentage points lower than this weeks reading  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202105050621AAIINeutralpng The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average 100 would be fully invested 0 would be market neutral 100 would be fully short and 200 would be leveraged short Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since midFebruary which also ranked in the top 2 of all readings going back to 2006 This week it fell 1593 points That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March but at 8779 the index

       " array([' PriceFacebook currently trades at around 330 Its latest support is at around 296 to 300 and its latest resistance is actually around 330 so essentially the price that its trading for right now This is a crucial moment If it manages to break 330 then we can see an upward movement going up to 360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming If you havent invested yet it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to 315 or worst case scenario 300 It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably wont see a lot of movement in the next week or two However as I said I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting 360 in a few months and maybe even 400 by the end of the year Why Well Facebook has been delivering great results after great results The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far Absolutely amazing In fact out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016 it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue twice The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin especially in the last 4 quarters Last quarter it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41 This is massive Especially for a company of Facebooks size Essentially what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected Also there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebooks Full Year 2021 earnings which is a very good sign 39 upward revisions in total There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarters earnings which is almost always a good sign Also out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating The BusinessHowever lets leave analyst opinions aside for the moment They are good to gauge Wall Streets appetite for the company but lets look at the business at the fundamentals Is Facebook really a good company Facebooks main source of revenue are the advertising revenues that come from ads on its products the Facebook app and website Instagram Whatsapp and Messenger By gathering user data Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive but are also more attractive to advertisers Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world Facebook which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube Instagram is extremely popular as well ranking in the 23rd place As of the latest quarter the Daily active users of Facebooks family of products are 272 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 345 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US This is literally half of the worlds population Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15 yearonyear which is actually faster than last years increase of 11 So we can see that their user base is growing but is that translating into higher revenues The answer yes In 2020 Facebook reported a 20 yearonyear advertising revenue increase but in their last quarter alone the advertising revenue increase was 46 compared to last year Advertising makes about 98 of Facebooks revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits Their net income also grew by 58 in 2020 yearonyear and an astonishing 94 in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year Essentially we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business However Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs While this side of Facebook is still tiny it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well In the first quarter of 2021 its revenue grew by almost 150 as compared to last year and now makes up 27 of Facebooks revenue VR and AR are still relatively young industries but they are growing fast as we can see Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42 from 37B in 2019 to an astonishing 127T in 2030 Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook Unlike its competitors Facebooks business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business The company has also grown its headcount by 30 in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth Despite that analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15 annually for the next 3 years To some extent that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID However I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20 and 25 especially when we consider the VR and AR business This may sound optimistic but given Facebooks record of beating analyst estimates I am okay with sounding optimistic The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation which is always on the table for big tech companies like it However it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so Ill take my chances The Balance SheetNow you may be thinkinggreat Facebook is positioned well for the future but how are the fundamentals looking right now We can see they are growing but can they support that growth Personally I think so Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents They currently have just over 64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a 225B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost 10B since December 2019 The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition but most importantly it means that the company is doing well We can also see that in the companys share repurchase program Facebook has repurchased 63B of shares in 2020 and 42B of shares in 2019 and in January 2021 it authorized an additional 25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about 34B This doesnt mean that they will repurchase all 34B but that they can Still the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign In addition to their massive stockpile of cash Facebook only has liabilities of 30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile What does that mean It means that Facebook is healthy and its taking its vitamins The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short or mediumterm challenges to its business It has no longterm debt meaning that if they do decide to borrow money they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals The RatiosThen if we look at some the fundamental ratios we can see that Facebook is A Beast Their ReturnonAssets is 203 compared to the industrys average of 103 and their ReturnonEquity was 253 last year Lets compare it to its rivals I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter Google and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth In terms of ROA and ROE both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so theres not much point in comparing them but Google has a 153 ROA Their ROE is also lower at 223 as opposed to Facebooks 253 Now Facebooks forward Pricetoearnings ration is only 216 whereas Google has 255 Twitters is 524 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92 so again Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings In terms of current PE Facebook has 282 Google has 322 and Snapchat and Twitter dont have one because they are unprofitable The current SP average PE is 372 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business but its also at a very good price relative to its peers Even looking at it historically Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 2728 so the current price is again excellent and cheap This is my own opinion feel free to do your own research but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12 annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at 330 That is assuming a 15 earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 3032 If the earnings grow at around 20 next year then we can look at a roughly 15 annual return which is higher than the average return of the SP 500 meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market at least in my opinionx200BWhat do you guys think Im sure that Ive missed something in my analysis but I think that Ive covered the main bits It can obviously be more detailed so Ill be happy if you can point out any gaps ',\n",

it is essential for regulators to address the issues surrounding the unlawful tactics that short sellers may employ in order to drastically reduce the share price of publicly tradedcompanies  I am writing this article using the example of On trak Behavioural Health Services The Company hereafter a publicly traded company  I have owned shares of this company in the past and may purchase shares of this company in the future  I will also include a few examples of other companies in this due diligence and everything writtenherein is merely my opinion  I am not a financial advisor  Please do your own research  This article is for entertainment purposes only Lets get to itWhat happened and why am I writing thisThe Company provides online mental health and behavioural health services for people suffering with mental illness and the platform is actually genious  The Company saw the need for access to 247 1on1 mental health care via online service which is much more accessible for individuals who require immediate care or are care avoidant  The service is widely used by people with substance abuse issues veterans trauma survivors etc  Furthermore The Companys modelling showed that providingthis type of health care online caused a huge savings benefit for the medical system and insurance companies on the whole because it treated the issues at the source online and often prevented very expensive post incident care think of police and hospital resources  Insurance companies and even Medicare and Medicaid were aware of the savings and included The Companys services in their health insurance plans  The Companys stock saw a meteoric rise from about 3 to over 100 as more insurancecompanies signed on to the serviceThen whatIn early 2019 The Companys stock was trading between 1015  A short selling research company under the name Culper Research began covering the stock and took particularissue with The Companys CEO at the time  Culper Research itself is neither a company or really a legit entity  It operates under pseudonyms and behind proxy servers with no real way of contacting them through any legitimate means  Often websites that they operate to provide their research publicly are registered to law offices or shell companies in the Caribbean or South Pacific  They mostly attack companies through social media platforms like twitter stocktwits shady websites etc and then pay to have articles submitted through the newswire via their offshore company  Anyway it was Culpers opinion at the time that The Company would be unable to secure insurance companies into their behavioural health services system so they provided research attacking The Companys CEO  The intial Culper hit piece was fairly tame it questioned The Companys fundamentals and ability to sign clients  Culper took particular beef with the CEO and filled the report with the usual FUD  The report coincided with a hedge fund taking a MASSIVE SHORT POSITION AGAINST THE COMPANY AMOUNTING TO 40 OF ALL AVAILABLE SHARES  So there was a lot of money behind this research and a huge interest in The Companys failure  Things didnt go well for Culper and the hedge funds associated with them and The Company signed more insurance companies and clients and the stock kept rising   This is when things turned ugly  Let me say this I have never seen anything so disgusting published across the newswire without any sort of legal repercussion  Culper Research paired with Hindenburg Research and stepped up their attacks immensely  You apes familiar with the GME short seller reports know how ugly they can get  In the subsequent reports Culper and Hindenburg accused the CEO of embezzlement sex crimes fraud misapproriation of shareholder money and even supporting wars  Racist jabsand questioning the character of the care providers were all listed in the report  The Companys stock briefly fell but recovered and kept rising in spite of the report  Upon reading it I contacted The Companys investor relations and notified them of the report which they said they were aware of and could not discuss how they were addressing this legally  The report was deleted from Culper and Hindenburgs website at a later date of courseWell the stock kept risingCulper and Hindenburg needed to step it up because their hedge fund clients were losing hundreds of millions of dollars  And step it up they did  They began publishing reports almost twice a week and referring to them over the newswire and spamming them across twitter  Stock message boards became flooded with individuals who would hyperlink the reports they issued and spread FUD  Message boards that were generally quiet were flooded with bearish messages and false statements  Culper and Hindenburg stepped up their illegal activity which was admitted in their own reports by contacting health care workers who work for the platform by pretending to need to behavioural health servicesthey provided  They would mask as being suicidal or depressed and then they would press the health care workers about their pay compensation packages what they know about the CEO and the company which health care insurance companies did they use etc  Culper and Hindenburg then released their findings in their weekly almost daily reportsFor example theyd write when we contacted the clinician using their service they told us that they only worked 20 hours a week and that they were not receiving compensation for mental stressStill the stock kept rising  Once again I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were contacting health care employees to uncover confidential information and that they were spinning it to create FUD  The Company said that they were aware of the issue and that they were advising their staff to be waryCulper and Hindenburg then began issuing reports which had patient information included  This was done to scare patients into thinking that their information was not secure  Once again this was all in their reports  My guess is that they had one of their own people hired by The Company and this health care provider proded patients for information  Either that or they were just flat out lying  The reports would say patient did not have any reduction in suicidal thoughts patient did not feel better at the end of the session several patients felt confused after the session  They would couple this information with a decline in client retention rates or turnover  Remember these are extremely vulnerable often care avoidant individuals who are desperate for mental health care  This is a sickening act in my opinion  I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were releasing client information and discussions in their reports and The Company gave me the usual response  The stock kept risingIn my opinion their latest nasty shot at The Company could very well be the worst  This is opinion and can not be proven but I suspect it to be true  The Companys largest signed clientwas Aetna Health Insurance followed by Cigna  It is my opinion that Culper and Hindenburg began to lobby Aetna and Cigna with their false reports accusations FUD and the patient information on an almost daily basis  The goal was to have these health insurance providers drop The Companys mental health services from their insurance plans  Many veterans and individuals locked at home with abusers or their own thoughts during the Covid crisis are dependant on these services in order to get through their daytoday and can not afford the care unless it is covered by their health insurance plans  Well if they were lobbying it worked  Aetna abruptly terminated their agreement with The Company and thousands of patients were forced to lose care with their health care provider or be transitioned to another provider  This was devastating  Hundreds of health care service providers lost their jobs and thousands of patients will likely no longer get the care they require  Upon announcing the termination of the contract with Aetna the stock dropped from 105 to about 28 or soI notified the company that Aetna was likely lobbied by Culper and Hindenburg and they responded that they needed to focus on patient care and patient transitioning at the moment but that A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAD MADE THEM AWARE OF THIS  Culper and Hindenburg have since deleted all these reports from their websites and Twitter accounts however The Company has all the reports and so do INow the hedge funds that backed Culper and Hindenburg still have a big problem  Despite the fall in the stock price the trading volume has been extremely low and they have been unable to cover most of their short position  The stock is still currently shorted to the tune of about 36 of the free float  On top of that much of their short position was taken between1015 per share so they are still way underwater  On top of that the company is recovering  They are signing Medicare and Medicaid care contracts  They are signing a serviceprovision contract with Veterans Affairs directly  Recently the Biden administration has earmarked 96bn for the VA and VA mental health services in the new 6tn budget  The CEO of The Company resigned his position and a new CEO a veteran in the health care industry was brought on as CEO  I believe the new CEO will be much more ruthless with Culper and Hindenburg and I believe that this is why they have deleted a lot of their research  If I were a betting man Id say that they have multiple lawsuits coming their wayWhy did I write thisA friend of mine was a military helicopter pilot who served in Afghanistan  He was a career military kind of guy who really loved his job and serving his Country  When he came back from Afghanistan he completely changed  A normally outgoing person he became withdrawn antisocial and began behaving oddly  He confided in his close friends that he was strugglingwith mental health issues but was afraid to seek help because of the stigma attached to it and fear of losing his rank  This is someone who would have benefited immensely from these services because they are 247 confidential and covered through health insurance  Sadly he didnt get the help he needed and committed suicide in 2017  Was Culper or Hindenburg ever held responsible for their actions  Do they simply withdraw into the woodwork  Will they continue to lobby other insurance providers in an attempt to drive the price down further  How many lives were lost and will be lost by people who are told that they no longer have access to mental health care servicesIm watching it closely but I feel like I have been beating my head against the wall because no one does anything to hold them accountableJosh',\n",

up The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday In my view this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Feds commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a string of strong labor reports like the one in March While I said all week that I thought the initial selloff was an overreaction and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days shortterm volatility may continue going into next week too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing  On Wednesday the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index CPI which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs rose 42 from a year ago compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 36 increase The monthly gain was 08 against the expected 02 Excluding the volatile food and energy prices the core CPI this is the main measure of inflation increased 3 compared to the same period in 2020 and 09 on a monthly basis The respective estimates were 23 and 03 Yesterday the producer price index PPI which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 62 compared to April 2020 and 06 monthly increase The core PPI which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 46 year over year and 07 in April Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 03 monthly increase in April and 38 year over year This is the biggest jump since 2014 In tandem with the CPI report this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected However while the readings in inflation definitely are not good it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not The April Job Report bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy In addition at a separate event in April Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper well before the interest rate is increased He said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance In short while the inflationary readings are not great Im fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy soonerthanexpected are overblown Just my two cents Highlights The Labor Department Released

continued Technology stocks continued their volatility with the Nasdaq QQQ going as low as 142 down intraday before recovering and closing 059 down The SP 500 SPY closed 026 down and the Dow Jones DIA closedStocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently which saw the SPY pulling back 4 before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index PPI came in higher than expected The CPI which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs rose 42 from a year ago compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 36 increase The monthly gain was 08 against the expected 02 Excluding the volatile food and energy prices the core CPI this is the main measure of inflation increased 3 compared to the same period in 2020 and 09 on a monthly basis The respective estimates were 23 and 03 The PPI which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 62 compared to April 2020 and 06 monthly increase The core PPI which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 46 year over year and 07 in April Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 03 monthly increase in April and 38 year over year This is the biggest jump since 2014 In tandem with the CPI report this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected While the readings in inflation definitely are not good it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before Talking about the March Job report Powell said We want to see a string of months like that like in March so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great theres a very large group of people who are not The April Job Report bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy In addition at a separate event in April Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper well before the interest rate is increased He said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance In short while the inflationary readings are not great Im fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy soonerthanexpected are overblown Just my two cents There are several factors in my opinion contributing to the rise of inflation First after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials limiting production capability and driving up delivery time and as a result driving up prices One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up inflation is expected to slow down In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory In an April 28 meeting Jerome Powell said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits Federal debtincurred when the government sells Treasury bonds bills notes and other securities to cover its costsrecently hit an alltime high However policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels Jerome Powell said Given the low level of interest rates theres no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview saying Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected longterm bond yields declined indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserves commitment to move slowly when raising ratesHighlights On Monday morning ATT T and Discovery Inc DISCA announced a deal under which ATTs WarnerMedia will be spun off and combined with Discovery in a new standalone media company The new

inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program In separate comments Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation Richard Clarida Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve also said there will come a time in upcoming meetings when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that it is going to depend on the flow of data The Fed is currently buying 120 billion a month in governmentissued

strategiesThis post isnt about doing EPS or IV projections  Its simply about how you can keep doing ongoing research about the general direction and prices of lumber the commodity as well as any major newsopinions out there that could affect the commoditys future direction  I find it very helpful because on weeks like this one where everyone lost their fucking minds because the price of used cars went up a bit I held strong because in the end I knew the CPI report and the panic selling that followed didnt change the market fundamentals driving the lumber industrys record profits  I didnt panic when futures went red the last few days because I know how well these companies will do even if lumber prices drops another 30 and I knew that the cash markets were doing just fine  So this market feel research helps you have confidence in your investment so you can ignore the daily noiseBasic Links for understanding the Current State of Lumber IndustryI think it will be helpful for people to know exactly why lumber is surging and the market dynamics that caused it because you can then use that to make educated guesses at whether your various companies still have long term value and have

This will help you start to figure out whether you should stick with your investment when lumber dips from its high after the summerApparently Social Media Actually has a Positive UseI dont use social media but I got a twitter account for work related reconnaissance and then found out that a handful of extremely knowledge people in the lumber industry are tweeting at each other nonstop about things going on in the cash markets  futures as well as the occasional opinions  These people often post articles on the area or new podcasts  So its a great way to keep yourself educated  Also they are just good people and it can be entertaining to see whats going on with them any particular dayIt can be insightful and calming on red days especially since normal members of the public cant see whats happening in the cash markets real time but sometimes these guys will let you know  The other day when all the futures were nose diving cash markets were still up meaning the immediate price of lumber was doing just fine and it the red was really from the speculators jumping ship which is a good thingDeacon Lumber CEO Stinson

lumber some cost more like Eastern SPF and some cost less like Southern Yellow Pine  SYP  But this can help you get a sense what the future outlook may look like generally  But remember these prices can change  They can go up or down these arent guarantees of the future price of lumber  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesnt mean it will stay that wayNasdaq Lumber futures Graphhttpswwwnasdaqcommarketactivitycommoditieslbs  a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically  Why is this important  Because you can look at the 2018 levels see how well these companies did then  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak then you really dont need to panic  The industrys breakeven price is generally around 400 mfbm  2018 hit 600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them  So maybe you dont need to panic sell when the futures dip below 1200 from their 16001700 peak  What matters is where it settles  Also you can see that in 2020 the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazyMadisons Lumber Reports

These datesprices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at 20 The total market has grown 40 since then comparing total market index then and now which all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of 28  not bad But clearly were not factoring in vaccine profits Moderna was approved in the US in mid December 1 and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at 10447This price already seems too high though depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for 15 to 20 per dose 2 They reached a deal to sell the US 300 million and the EU 150 million doses generously totaling 10 billion A one time sale yet their market cap has increased 10x from 75 bil to 75 bil read overbought 3 The only way this makes ANY sense is if theyre counting on a significant mass of the global population  1 billion people  note they have plans to make 14 bil doses in 20222 to purchase booster shots every year To their credit they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a long term supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022 but this is a far cry from their required numbers this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring  1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyersI dont think so and I think the market reflects my uncertainty First Modernas main competitor Pfizer has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two 45 Furthermore with Pfizer JJ Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive Lastly and very importantly a large fraction of the people who havent YET got the vaccine never intend to nearly 40 of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID19 vaccine when it becomes available to them 6 This information combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb MRNAs boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions 1 yr chart dec 11 feb 19 may 4th And the reason its going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case If they maintain their current market share at 500 million vaccines per yr unlikely as we will see this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the 104 price we saw in January So the base prediction given information heretonow is that MRNA will dump to 110 a 40 decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all alongAnd furthermore it seems the covid treatmentprevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work Ivermectin is a cheap notunderpatent common drug thats been used for forty years as a common antiparasiticIn Latin America where the US fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found the people and the market have settled on a different solution The drug has been so in demand that in May healthcare workers passed out some 350000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia That same month the Peruvian police seized around 20000 bottles of animalgrade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections And in July a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30000 doses to bolster the countrys supply 7 This article advocates caution because at the time data is scant But that was many months ago oct 2020 now the data is inWhat started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish 8 but would it do the same to covid in the human body Well  what was the result of the mass buying in Peru For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment and Lima excess deaths quickly dropped by 75 after only 45 days 9 Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99 effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively One trial done in Argentina had 1200 healthcare workers 400 did not take Ivermectin and the other 800 did Of the 400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid Of the 800 who did take it 0 ZERO fell ill 1011 And lastly metaanalysis studies 98 of the 52 studies to date report positive effects Random effects metaanalysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81 reduction RR 019 009039 and prophylactic use shows 85 improvement RR 015 009025 Mortality results show 76 lower mortality RR 024 014042 for all treatment delays and 84 lower RR 016 004063 for early treatment 1213Remember when India was getting devastated by covid Seems like yesterday Where did all that news go Well theres this many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult14 What about Africa Didnt analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster Well a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19 15 How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease right 16 That being said they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot but still relevantSo what do you guys think Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market Love to hear some people who

policy have tempered in recent weeks with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level This week the indexes have largely consolidated an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices causing the Federal Reserve to

Market Committee FOMC reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program In separate comments Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation Richard Clarida Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve also said there will come a time in upcoming meetings when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that it is going to depend on the flow of data The Fed is currently buying 120 billion a month in governmentissued and governmentbacked securities and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recoveredThis reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will as they have said time and again wait for concrete data before any considerations are made This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14 which proves market participants shouldnt worry about quantitative easing tapering in my opinion Powell said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidanceThe Department of Labors Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless

       " array(['I started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post insteadLets say currently the inflation is 0 a burger costs 1 and a single stock  share of any company costs 20 You can buy 20 burgers if you sell that shareTomorrow the inflation becomes 10 Everything is more expensive by 10 The burger now costs 11 the share costs 22 You can still buy 20 burgers for that share But if you have sold that share yesterday at 20 today you can buy only 18 burgers Your money lost buying power due to inflation Thats why some people say that during the inflation its better to have money in the market you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks But its often not that simple well return to this at the endThe government doesnt like 10 inflation its too high They like 5 inflation To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers When less people compete for the goods the price of those goods decreases How can government decrease the demand They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks Now instead of spending 11 on the burger you can put that money into the bank and over time your money will grow in value and in 30 years youll be able to buy 1000 burgers Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification so only part of people will put money into the bank the others will continue buying burgers Anyway the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to 105 thats 5 inflation exactly what the government wantsNow lets talk about the banks How do they earn money They do it by offering loans Lets say a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers The company does not earn anything yet so the plan is to get money from the bank build the product then start earning and then repay the debts Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10 extra later Where did bank get that money Well most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account Your money is safe no one can steal it and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest Everyone is happyYou remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation right Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing But now you started to earn some interest on it Lets say its 5 per year This makes banks sad because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10 from the SkyNet company they now also need to pay you those 5 Obviously they wont pay it out of their own pockets They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10 but 15 at the end of the loan periodThe SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks Its difficult as they have no earnings yet Where do they take the money to pay banks They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors More shares means more supply More supply means that the price of the good drops so the shares of that company become much cheaperSo if youre sure that inflation is inevitable how can you prepare for this We discussed that a bit at the beginning One option is to keep money in your account Your 20 will lose some value youll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20 Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company As weve just discussed it will likely drop in value and will cost like 12 youll buy only 11 burgers for it But who knows maybe in 5 years itll pay of And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable Most likely it costs 25 now and you can buy more burgers with itYouve already figured it out The burger company is what we call a value stock The SkyNet company is the growth stock And since everyone expects inflation we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks',\n",

of my posts have been taken down I wont be able to post on here anymore Ill have to find another place that will have me The Income StatementWhat is itThe income statement is one of the most common and important financial  statements youll come across Its also known as the profit and loss  PL statement summarizing all income and expenses over the period  of analysis often shared as quarterly and annual reportsWhat is its purposeThe function of an income statement is to show a companys financial performance over the period of analysisWhat is inside an income statement Revenue The amount of money a business takes in during a reporting period Expenses The amount of money a business spends during a reporting period Costs of goods sold COGS The cost of component parts of what it takes to make whatever it is a business sells Gross profit Total revenue less COGS Operating income Gross profit less operating expenses Income before taxes Operating income less nonoperating expenses Net income Income before taxes less taxes Earnings per share EPS Division of net income by the total number of outstanding shares Depreciation The extent to which assets for example aging equipment have lost value over time EBITDA Earnings before interest depreciation taxes and amortizationThese items often contain sub categories and separate line items depending on a companys reporting and accounting policiesClassifying ExpensesThere are three different types of expenses1 Operating Expensesa Expenses associate with the operations of the businessb Direct costs of producing the productservice and other expenses associated with production including SGA expenses2 Financing Expensesa Expenses associated with the use on nonequity financingb Most often taking form of interest expenses on debt3 Capital Expensesa Expenses that provide benefits over many yearsb For a manufacturing company these can be plant  equipmentc For nonmanufacturing companies they can be less conventional and tangible formsTheir PlacementNo images allowed on the sub so heres a link httpsimgurcomWCDqBeehttpsimgurcomWCDqBee     SUMMARY  Operating expenses associate with operations of the business financing  expenses with nonequity financing and capital expenses with ones that  provide benefit over many years Revenue RecognitionFor  most firms revenue recognition is a simple process where once a  product or service is sold it is recorded as revenues For firms that  sell products or services over many years eg subscriptions it becomes  trickierUnder ASC 606 new revenue recognition standard The  new models core principle for revenue recognition is to depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services Thus  for a real estate developer working on a multiyear construction  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized  SUMMARY For most firms when a product or service is sold it is  recorded as revenues For firms that deal with long term contracts  memberships subscriptions etc revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration  eg 120000 for 1 year of service  10000month recorded  revenue Revenue breakdownsAs companies enter multiple businesses and different geographies it is useful to know where they generate their revenuesWhere are geographic breakdowns found While the breakdown can sometimes by provided in income statements they are more likely to be part of the footnotes to the financial statements Companies generally break down revenues by geography though the degree of detail can vary Companies also break down revenues by business segment though there is an element of subjectivity to the segment categorization SUMMARY Companies generally break down revenues by geography with a varying degree of detail and revenues by business segments  subjective to the segment categorization Both can sometimes be found  in the income statement but generally they are found in the footnotes of the financial statements Operating expenses BreakdownOperating  expenses are broken down into expenses directly related to producing  the goods or services that give rise to revenues ie cost of goods  sold and expenses that are related to operations but which are not as  directly tied to revenuesHow are operating expense broken down1 Expenses directly related to the production of goods  services that increase revenues These are netted out form revenues to get gross profits2 Expenses related to operations not directly tied to revenues These are netted out from gross profits to get operating incomeSGA Costs1 In many companies the largest nonoperating expense is S G  A a term that can include everything but the kitchen sink SUMMARY Companies break down revenues by how they relate to production or operations The former tied to the increase of revenues the latter not DepreciationThere are three forms of depreciation economic accounting  tax depreciation1 Economic DepreciationThis reflects the loss in value earning power in an asset as it ages It requires nuance and will vary across even the same type of assets depending on how it is used2 Accounting DepreciationThis is more mechanical and is driven largely by the aging of the asset with the differences often being in whether it happens uniformly over the life of the asset or is more accelerated3 Tax DepreciationThis reflects what the tax authorities will allow as depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income SUMMARY Economic depreciation reflects loss in value earning power in an asset as it ages Accounting depreciation is driven by the aging of an asset depending if it occurs over the life time of the asset or in a more accelerated period Tax depreciation reflects what authorities allow as depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income Financial expensesThe most common financial expense is interest expense on debt either in the form of bank loans or corporate bondsSome interest expense is implicitAs accountants classify other commitments such as leases as debt some of the interest expense is implicit ie it is calculated by accountants based upon their assessment of the debt equivalent value of commitments and current interest ratesIf interest income exceeds interest expense this number will measure net interest incomeIn some companies interest expenses are netted out against interest income earned by the company on its cash holdings and financial investments and reported as a net interest expense If interest income exceeds interest expense this number will measure net interest income SUMMARY Most common financial expense is interest expense on debt either bank loans or corporate bonds Accountants classify other

nonoperating investmentsIncome  earned from cash  marketable securities are reported different  then income earned from cross holdings in other companiesCash  Marketable SecuritiesIncome earned on cash holdings which is invested in marketable securities like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies will be reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expensesCross holdings in other companies Reporting can vary upon the magnitude of your holding When you hold a small or minority portion of another company the income from that holding will usually be reported in the income statement If you hold a majority stake of another company you will generally have to consolidate your financials You will count 100 of the subsidiarys revenues operating expenses and operating income as your own SUMMARY Income earned on cash holdings will be reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses Income earned from minority stake in a company will usually be reported in the income statement If you hold a majority  stake of another company you will consolidate 100 of its revenues  operating expenses and operation income as your

include Onetime expense or gain from sale of assets or divisions Write offs or charges associated with past project lawsuits or fines Impairment of goodwill from acquisitions in the pastTruly extraordinary items If an item is truly extraordinary it should show up infrequently and the amount associated with it should vary SUMMARY Extraordinary items and expenses capture what a company does not face in the ordinary course of operations If an item shows up regularly and consistently it is not extraordinary Income Statement AnalysisThere are two methods to read and analyze financial documents vertical and horizontal analysisVertical AnalysisNo images allowed on the sub so heres a link httpsimgurcomtsbdF73httpsimgurcomtsbdF73This  method of analysis as the name suggests is top  down You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentageThis type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries and between companies because you can  see relative  proportions It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improvingVertical analysis isnt  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked  such as Where did costs rise or fall What line items are contributing most to profit margins How are they affected over timeEg  here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by sideHorizontal AnalysisNo images allowed on the sub so heres a link httpsimgurcomZkgy21yhttpsimgurcomZkgy21yThis method of analysis focuses on yearoveryear YoY or quarteroverquarter QoQ performanceHorizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles GAAP It improves the review  of a  companys consistency over time as well as its growth compared to   competitorsBecause of this  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts By  conducting a horizontal analysis you can tell whats been  driving an  organizations financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns line item by line item Ultimately  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over timecomparisons  from Q1 to  Q2 for exampleinstead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to othersTo perform horizontal analysis you1 Take the value of Period N2 Divide it by the value of Period N13 Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage changeEg  Revenue in 2017 was 4000 and in 2016 it was 3000 The YoY change in revenue is 40003000  1

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th 2021 Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210521stockscouldbevolatileinweekaheadamidturbulencefromcryptocurrencyhtml The trading pattern of the past two weeks  particularly alongside cryptocurrencys movements  suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead Investors are watching the wild swings in bitcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week The Dow and SP 500 were lower in the past week but Nasdaq was slightly higher helped by a positive move in tech as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet Facebook and Netflix A steep plunge in bitcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week The US also called for stricter compliance with the IRS Further on Friday China said it would crack down on bitcoin mining and trading Whats interesting is the market is being bullied around by where bitcoin goes said Peter Boockvar chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group Bitcoin plunged by as much as 30 on Wednesday to about 30000 Though it recovered to above 42000 it slid again on Friday The cryptocurrency was down about 9 late Friday hovering around 36000 according to Coin Metrics Bitcoin is a poster child for risk appetite said Boockvar It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground if were getting dragged along by bitcoin There is some key data in the week ahead Consumer confidence home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday Durable goods will be released Thursday and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator the Feds preferred inflation measure The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance said Boockvar What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers is where the inflation expectations go The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3 in April The core PCE price index was up 18 year over year in March In the week ahead earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers like Best Buy Costco and Nordstrom NVIDIA and Dell also report  No correction yet As the market has chopped around this month dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains Some strategists do not see a correction just yet though pullbacks could continue For me my framework is we can only get a 10 correction when we have a liquidity set back when we have a policy tightening said Barry Knapp managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics In any of the little disturbances we are getting about a 4 to 6 pullback Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies You should be in the cyclical parts of tech he said Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week gaining 01 but semiconductors popped nearly 3 Software was up 02 The Nasdaq was 03 higher on the week to 13470 while the Dow was off a half percent at 34207 The SP 500 was down 04 to 4155 The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts up 09 followed by health care up 07 Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF up 11 It wouldnt shock me if we went straight back to new highs Knapp said Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging He said earnings for the SP 500 are now expected to be up 7 more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer and that is the likely trigger for a correction Back to World War II he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy Last cycle we had eight of those he said Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events Knapp said its natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now Its an uncertainty shock he said It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit The bitcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington and the infrastructure spending could be positive The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout he said noting bitcoin gained on the

an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation In fact most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders delivery times and prices even at or just off of record highs But there were a handful that moved lower delivery times inventories and number of employees Regarding expectations it was much harder to find an increase Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month While many indices for expectations still sit at historically

Additionally the index is at a much less elevated part of its range the 81st percentile relative to other indices within the report but the much more elevated reading in expectations 98th percentile would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers That is there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses expectations to take on more workers Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers the average workweek has continued to climb At 187 the index is at its highest level in a decade  CLICK HERE FOR THE

to the low housing inventories low rates and strong demand despite the headwinds of rising costs While that could have played into the small decline in traffic future sales did tick higher  CLICK HERE

has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year the other regions all peaked out in the fall For the Midwest the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone The West and South on the other hand have

the market ie crypto have experienced wild swings As a result sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move The American Association of Individual Investors weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37 Although that was not a large move in the past week sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50 In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past halfyear the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average In other words optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective  CLICK HERE FOR THE

pressure and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants The Nasdaq QQQ sank 253 its worst performance since March Meanwhile the Dow Jones DIA reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the SP 500 SPY retreated from record levels closing 095 downMarket participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices This in turn may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soonerthanexpected pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks However it is important to note that monetary officials including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be transitory In an April 28 meeting he said Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened Inflation has risen largely reflecting transitory factors Overall financial conditions remain accommodative in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to US households and businesses Looking ahead the US Bureau of Labor Statistics April consumer price index CPI is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index PPI on Thursday These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers and are expected to show a significant jump over last years pandemicdepressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopensFurther spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from overheating She said It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesnt overheat even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive I think our economy will grow faster because of them In later remarks she seemingly downplayed her remarks saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve She said Let me be clear thats not something Im predicting or recommending If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed I think that person is meWhile it may seem like doom and gloom this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldnt begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating Last Friday the April Job Report reported only 266000 jobs added in the month of April missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916000 jobs added in March Despite significant progress the economy remains roughly 82 million jobs short compared to prepandemic levels and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020 The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a string of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made With the April report coming in far below estimates the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soonIn short a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020 and while substantial progress has been made economic recovery particularly in the labor market remains far from completeHighlights Pfizer PFE and BioNTech BNTX submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK anticipating GDP will grow 725 in the country up from its forecast for 5 growth in February The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 25 in 2021 up from its prior forecast for 2 but said the rise in price pressures will likely be temporary The trial between Epic Games vs Apple AAPL has commenced Epic has accused Apple of violating US antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developers hit video game Fortnite from its App Store Apple has

I have said for weeks there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index which saw the SP 500 SPY lose 4 in three trading days was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks The SPY closed 101 and is only 3 points away from its alltime high The techheavy Nasdaq QQQ closed 168 higher and the Dow Jones DIA closed 56 higher As the US economy reopens we are seeing a surge in consumer spending we saw a 108 increase in spending in March supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand which of course causes a rise in prices As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up inflation is expected to slow down In a nutshell this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitoryMoreover while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index as has been reiterated in the recap before the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered In the Federal Reserves April meeting minutes participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committees maximumemployment and pricestability goals  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a string of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered The April Job Reports showed only 266000 jobs added back to the economy widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March bolsters that argumentOn a slightly sour note the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested that as the economy continues to quickly it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase which have currently been going at a rate of 120 billion per month However its important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials argument that the labor market remains below the Feds targets and roughly 82 million jobs short compared to prepandemic times onth However this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before Back in an April 14 meeting Powell said We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December That would in all likelihood be before well before the time we would consider raising interest rates We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance As a reminder quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy It is only natural that as the economy recovers less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates which is what market participants are really concerned about Read the entire meeting minutes herehttpswwwfederalreservegovmonetarypolicyfilesfomcminutes20210428pdfMichael Jones CEO of Caravel Concepts said I do think its been a pretty

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st 2021 A big jobs report looms in the week ahead as markets enter the oftenweak month of June  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210528jobsreportloomsintheweekaheadasmarketsentertheoftenweakmonthofjunehtml Mays employment report is the big event in the week ahead as stocks enter the often weak month of June Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance Big cap indexes like the SP 500 and Dow notched gains The SP rose a half percent and the Dow rose 19 The small cap Russell 2000 was flat up 01 and the techheavy Nasdaq declined 15 June is not historically a strong month for stocks Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years the Dow has gained just 012 in June and has been positive 52 of the time But over the past 20 years June was far weaker gaining only 40 of the time Junes performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year with an average Dow decline of 07 according to Bespoke The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity but the most important measure will be Fridays jobs report According to Dow Jones economists expect Fridays employment report to show the creation of about 674000 jobs in May after the disappointing 266000 jobs added in April That was about a quarter of what economists had expected You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations the market is going to get nervous said George Goncalves head of US macro strategy at MUFG Hopefully we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz and we go into the Fed meeting and then were Hey the economy is still on track  Big June event The Fed meets June 1516 and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary since the data is being compared with a weak period last year Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes not expected until at least 2023 If inflation runs too hot the Feds main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity In theory higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higheryielding bond investments over stocks The next big read for the economy is Fridays jobs report and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday It showed core inflation running at 31 year over year the strongest reading for that measure since 1992 The Feds beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday and ISM services is released Thursday Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday  Inflation flareup The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2 target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level Inflation has been running mostly below 2 prior to the latest numbers With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks hotter than expected the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory said Julian Emanuel head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors One of those stocks AMC closed off 15 on Friday after rallying 116 in the past week giving it a 2021 gain of 1200 The net net on the index level is basically its a stock market thats moving sideways Emanuel said Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run When you look at it in the medium term the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Feds paying insufficient attention to price stability Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Feds 2 target The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2 going back to 1989 is a decline of 16 with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform he said Technology stocks as measured by the SP information technology sector gained 16 in the past month and are up 59 year to date The sector is lagging the SP 500s 12 gain The topperforming sectors have been cyclical year to date with energy up 362 financials up 285 materials up 201 and industrials up 183 Communications services which contains some internet growth names gained 16 since the start of the year Health care has been outperforming information technology up 86 year to date In the past week the SP 500 gained 12 to 4204 and is within 1 of its alltime high The Dow rose 09 to 34529 and the Nasdaq was up 2 at 13748  Red flagOn the edges of the financial markets market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system In the past week institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday Theres way too much liquidity in the system and its happening as a result of the Feds ongoing QE but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus said Goncalves He said the funds from trillions in stimulus including to state and local governments have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system At the same time institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds now holding about 46 trillion Those funds also put pressure on the system since they put funds in Treasury bills Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse Theres no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system he said Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they dont have enough bills or shortterm commercial paper Theres not enough fixed income assets to go around said Goncalves He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio and they would prefer to find other higheryielding investments What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected he said This past week saw the following moves in the SP CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL SP TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEKhttpsiimgurcomKD7MPQqpng SP Sectors for this past week CLICK HERE FOR THE SP

economic data is either beating or missing economists forecasts it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas Driven by some improving COVID19 trends the economic backdrop has improved overseas while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the US This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many nonUS equity markets and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed nonUS stocks We believe the improving COVID19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread For several years now being underweight European equities relative to the US has been a winning trade A seachange in that thinking could be approaching as valueheavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value but a firm constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index or CESI tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts As shown in the LPL Chart of the day economically global conditions remain rather strong as evidenced by these indices which remain above the zero line This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions The repair of global trade activity as supply lines are reconnected has been notably key in nonUS data outcomes  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi2wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads202105blogchart52721pngssl1 Looking ahead we expect now elevated economic expectations particularly in the US may prove a tougher target As a result economic surprises both in the US and abroad may fade as we move through the year However the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021 Global real GDP contracted 33 in 2020 and it is expected to rise to 60 in 2021 according to Bloombergs consensus estimate before ticking down to 34 in 2022 Although high US economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021 we still believe US stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas it is tough to overlook US companies innovation and profitability advantages explained LPL Financial

Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as looking for a correction when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point Coming in at 317 the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 276 and is in the top quartile of the historical range In other words it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence What is more significant is

dating back to 1963 there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30 for the first time in at least a year The most recent of these was in April 2009 In the table below we show the SP 500s performance in the year following those occurrences As shown performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75 of the time one month three months and one year out Additionally while there were two times 1982 and 2009 in which the SP 500 rallied over the following year without looking back there were another two times 2001 and 2007 that at the following years lows the SP 500 would end up lower by doubledigit percentage points

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th 2021 Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210514earningsreportsthefedwilltestthemarketrallyintheweekaheadhtml Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead as major retailers including Walmart and Home Depot report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar The Federal Reserve may also play a role Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday and after Aprils hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation market pros will watch it closely Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday Stocks have been volatile The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the weeks heavy losses The defensive consumer staples financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors The worst performers were consumer discretionary off about 37 for the week and tech which was down 22 Technology shares were among the best performers in Fridays rally up about 21 Energy was the best performer up more than 3 Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation said Art Hogan chief market strategist at National Securities Its not like the things that spooked us this week like inflation are going awayI think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks Fundstrat cofounder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic like airlines and hotels are ready to rise off the bottom He is still concerned about the tech sector which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care  Fed Ahead The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting But that was held before Aprils Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 42 year over year That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266000 payrolls a quarter of what was expected I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points Theyre thinking that one data point is not a trend said Joseph Song senior US economist at Bank of America But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying That would be a precursor to slowly ending the 120 billion a month asset purchase program and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates Hogan said when the weak employment report was released the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday We saw hot CPI hot PPI said Hogan referring to the producer price index That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper down nearly 2 for the week  Retail earnings and housing Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday Target TJX and Lowes release results Wednesday and BJs Wholesale and Kohls on Thursday Another disappointing data point was Fridays Aprils retail sales which came in flat with March But they are still at a high level Hogan said based on the sales report retailers should have done well Youre likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming It used to be Walmart Target Home Depot Lowes said Hogan He said now others have joined the list like TJX and Gap and should do well Besides earnings there is housing data The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday and housing starts are published Tuesday Existing home sales will be issued on Friday Hogan said depending on the data it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week He noted that DR Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week The home building index is off 5 for the week even with it being up 1 Friday This is a redhot sector that has lots of implications he said Whats good for home sales is good for auto sales Its good for Home Depot and Lowes Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday Scott Redler chief strategist at T3Livecom said by the end of the week some of the growth and tech names were trading better like Facebook and Alphabet The SP 500 held the 50day moving average which is constructive he said The SP 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50day which is the average price of the last 50 closes It is often a level that acts as support but if it is broken it can signal a negative trend The SP 500 was down about 15 for the week at 417385 The Nasdaq ended the week at 1342998 down 23 on the week The tech sector which has been under pressure held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week Redler said Friday It doesnt mean you can go into

Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 1300013200 range on the accompanying chart While we still do not expect any major decline here we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months  the Worst Six Month of the year MayOctober We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical Reposition in May period The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pentup pandemic demand Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months NovemberJune and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns Though we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000 If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the

developed international stocks recently for several reasons For one the US stock market has staged a tremendous rallythis week notwithstandingsince last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that arent pricing in so much optimism Valuations though not great timing tools are more attractive in Europe and Japan And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost nonUS stock returns Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks The developed international equity market mainly Europe and Japan is much more valuefocused than the US market based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the SP 500 Index As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the US In other words international tends to work when value works  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads20210551321BlogChart1pngssl1 Should strong performance by value stocks continueand we suspect it mightinternational stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials industrials and natural resources coupled with tech sector weakness gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the US as those economies fully reopen We can see how developed international stocks are more valuefocused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes As shown in the graphic below the US equity market represented by the SP 500 Index has a much higher technology sector allocation making it a more growthoriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities If digital media think Google and Facebook which are categorized as communication services and ecommerce think Amazon which is in consumer discretionary are included in this sector comparison the technology gap widens even further In essence for international to outperform US technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads20210551321BlogChart2pngssl1 At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the US is seeing now those markets may be in an even better position to outperform Until then we maintain our slight preference for US stocks over developed international  Bullish Sentiment Down Big The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill dropping 78

In todays Morning Lineup we covered some of the details of this mornings release of the NFIBs monthly survey on small business sentiment The survey showed rising prices tight labor market conditions and overall improving demand The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues For the majority of businesses cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent In total 64 of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem Meanwhile the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from big business Only 7 of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017 While up 1 percentage point in April cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses 6 of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013Click here to view Bespokes premium membership options

wasnt sure about sharing this but I figured I would because I think its important important for me and like I said I imagine for others too even if we dont usually talk about itIve been investing in a Roth IRA for a few years now but this February marked my first foray into more extensive investing  I was sitting on a lot of cash thanks to stimulus less consumption thanks to Covid and other reasons and decided now was the time to put it to work  I got into individual stocks because of GME  Sometimes Im kind of ashamed to say it because there seems to be a negative stigma attached to that and you know what I understand why the meme stock thing can be anywhere from facepalm to totally cringeworthy  I share that opinion in some ways  But at the same time I think that moment brought a lot of young folks into the market who actually have taken the time to learn about it and get serious and I think thats wonderfulFebruary 2021 was a bad time for a lot of us to get into the market because a lot of us tried chasing performance in things like ARK funds  I understand a lot of people got nailed  Luckily I was cautious about getting in tech after such a crazy bull run and I started out quite defensively  I havent lost money yet  Im slightly upBut man Ive rebalanced twice now  I mean the initial portfolio then a complete overhaul followed by another complete overhaul today Theres been innumerable minor tweaks and adjustments along the way too  In theory my allocations have gotten better as Ive gone along  My second portfolio definitely made more sense than my first but after this last readjustment Im left thinking what the hell did I even bother to change for   What I have now isnt bad I think but Im not sure its really better than what I had before  It might even be worse  Ill have to chew it over a bitThats the thing  Honestly I feel a bit overwhelmed  I could just make a rule alright whats done is done but thats not the best idea either  Sometimes things do change  Sometimes there are better plays  We learn and what not  So I dont feel comfortable making a rule about not making any changes and if I did make a rule Id probably break it anywayI dont know what to do anymore  Totally clueless  Go back to the old allocation  Keep things as they are  Wait and see  Im leaning towards wait and see  Just get this stuff of my chest  Ride the market a little more and

about individual stocks What if my pick underperforms or goes bankrupt  Theres always black swan events  And what about my future  Where will I be in 10 years  I wish I had all the answers but I dont  Nobody knows  And that can be frustratingOne last note  I know people are going to say just do index funds and be done with it   I already do them  thats all I have in my Roth IRA  Theyre a wonderful idea I get why people love them  That said the portfolio Im talking about here is in a taxable account and its money I may need in the midterm  Im young and my future is uncertain  I dont know if Im going to need to buy a house soon or a car or go back to school  I have a job but the pay isnt anything to write home about and its not necessarily something that Ill be able to do until I retire  I think a lot of young people can relateYes Ive got my 612 months in cash and Ive even got a tier 2 savings fund in series I bonds inflation protected check em out  But stillI dont want to just sit on cash especially since cash sucks right now  I want to put that extra money to work and make some returns even if theyre modest But at the same time I dont want my whole portfolio to go crashing down 50 suddenly  I lost the link if someone has it please let us know but theres this great website that shows you how your portfolio in dollar value not actual allocations would have been affected in different crashes dot com bubble 2008 etc  In 2008 a portfolio would decline over 50 IIRC and it would take 5 years and 5 months to recover   Great right  Buy and hold  Longterm time horizonYeah thats acceptable if youre 30 years old and saving for retirement  But for me its absolutely unacceptable if I need that money to put a down payment on a house in the next 35 years  You seeI wish people would be a bit more openminded when it comes to constantly recommending index funds  Like I said I think theyre a wonderful idea  probably the best for retirement  But at the same time every case is different and every market is different  Totally wonderful to recommend them but maybe the downvoting and criticism needs to be cut back a bit  Dialogue would be nice  Comprehension Not everyone has the same goals needs or time horizons  Were all learning here and nobody has the definitive answer for anyones financial situation especially not for yoursAnyway thats all guys  Love to hear your thoughts feelings and feedback  All the best and good luck to everyone',\n",

everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 7th 2021 AMC meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news  Sourcehttpswwwcnbccom20210604amcmemestockscouldsparkmoreheatintheweekaheadasinvestorsawaitinflationnewshtml Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting Mays consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday and it could be hot after it surged in April Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected Equities were higher in the past week but the meme stocks were far hotter AMC Entertainment gained another 100 and was up 2700 since January Energy was the bestperforming major sector gaining more than 67 as oil prices jumped nearly 5 in the past week REITs were the secondbest performer up 31 followed by financials up 12 and technology also up 12 But its the meme stocks that took the headlines and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market People think this is new It completely isnt Dan Niles founder of Satori Fund said of the trading frenzy He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999 when companies added dotcom to their names to attract investor attention Whats new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets they can work from home and theres nocost trading Those are the differences Niles said on CNBC So if it gets people interested in investing thats great What I dont like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed he added You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if youre going to play in something like this Steve Massocca managing director at Wedbush Securities said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath  Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last Its going to be around as long as cicadas are he said The SP 500 in the past week gained 06 rising to 4229 just 9 points from its alltime high The Dow was up 07 to 34756 and the Nasdaq gained 05 to 13814  Watching the inflation signs Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory Economists expect CPI to be up 47 year over year after Aprils 42 pace according to Dow Jones Core inflation is expected to be up 04 for the month and 34 year over year Im getting nervous Im seeing signs of a top Im systematically raising cash I think the market looks too expensive Massocca said Were going to shake off the dust from Covid The economy is going to be very very good and as a rule I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree He said the memes mania is just one sign but the spark for a selloff could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed Who knows what it is but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it the market is setting up for a 7 to 10 pullback at some point he said Who knows what starts it  One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market Fridays May employment report was being watched closely but the lowerthanexpected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being There were 559000 jobs added in May well below the 671000 expected Now the CPI report is the next point of focus ahead of the Feds June 1516 meeting The question is will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation or could it show that price increases are peaking Theres inflation out there You can see it everywhere said Massocca  Taper talk The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year with many strategists targeting the Feds Jackson Hole Wyoming symposium at the end of August The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action Then it will slowly reduce its buying After that it could consider interest rate hikes now not expected by the market until 2023 Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least 120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities When the Fed backs off of that with tapering I think thats when you can go in and say OK we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because thats when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money he said Thats when things start to get dangerous to the downside For now Niles said hes staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street You want to stay away from this stuff now unless youre doing it in very small size he said There are just a few earnings in the week ahead One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday

into todays jobs report for May it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that Aprils report threw at investors One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago where the consensus expectation was for 1000000 new jobs and we only got 266000 since revised up to 278000 On the one hand data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a one off among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data On the other hand it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons Moreover if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weakerthanexpected jobs market in this latter scenario should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery Against this backdrop investors were hoping that todays May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions It did not But that might actually be a good thing Here are some key takeaways  The US Bureau of Labor Statistics May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559000 jobs in May slightly below Bloombergsurveyed economists median forecast for a gain of 675000 The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27000 jobs  The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 58 though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate which moved from 617 to 616  Average hourly earnings rose 05 month over month again signaling lowerwage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected More new lowerwage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases It is hard to view 559000 added jobs as a disappointment but it does leave something to be desired explained LPL Financial Chief Market  Strategist Ryan Detrick There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day Mays jobs number did jump above Aprils disappointment but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066421BlogChart1pngssl1 Where do we go from here The US economy is still 76 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession and given the magnitude of that number we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lowerwage workers from returning to the labor market as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer In the last month about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report Also schools might be closing for the summer but daycare centers are reopening more broadly freeing parents up to find jobs Warmer weather everimproving vaccination trends and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook this cycle perhaps more than past cycles and for many that is the real story today The Federal Reserve Fed has made it clear it will tolerate nearterm inflation overshoots in order to achieve substantial further progress towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation Recent hotterthanexpected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Feds timeline for reducing their asset purchases which given their stated position will depend on strong payroll reports As such we find ourselves to a degree in a good news is bad news scenario as strong labor market readings could hasten the Feds timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy Todays report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its substantial further progress goal on employment and therefore all else equal will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports likely in the one million range before it begins to take action From a Fed intervention standpoint todays employment report likely found a sweet spot and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief For a deeper dive into the inflation picture check the blog on Thursday June 10 when data for the Consumer Price Index CPI measure of inflation is set to be released  Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months SP 500 is up an impressive 119 for the first five months of 2021 That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950 As illustrated in the graph above gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months MayOctober and even more so over the Worst Four Months JulyOctober We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 94 vs 147 for the top 20 first five months But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from lateOctober to yearend

May the SP 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain Incredibly this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May Who said Sell in May  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066221BlogChart1pngssl1 As we noted a month ago the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality After a nearly 90 rally off the lows stocks could be ripe for a pullback especially during the historically weak month of June explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick But with the improving economy coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus we expect any weakness to be shortlived  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi2wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066221BlogChart2pngssl1 Here are some stats to think about regarding SP 500 performance in June  Since 1950 June is the 4th worst month of the year September February and August are worse  It has been higher the past 5 years in a row the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s  The past 10 years though June was up 10 on average ranking as the 7th best month  According to Sam Stovall of CFRA only 5 market declines in excess of 5 started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months since WWII In other words it isnt common for major market weakness to start in June  Building on this when the SP 500 is lower in June it is down by 29 on average This is the second smallest average loss with only December better at 25 We wouldnt be surprised at all if stocks took a welldeserved break in June but this month is rather misunderstood as a massive selloff or the start of significant weakness isnt likely as that isnt what June typically brings Lastly last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the SP 500 In fact the SP 500 was up more than 10 on the 100th day which historically is a great start to the year but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day when stocks are up more than 10 on day 100 the rest of the year has been higher 842 of the time and up 86 on average both well above what the average year does We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixedincome position relative to investors targets as appropriate  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi1wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066221BlogChart3pngssl1  Less Than 20 Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks Bullish sentiment

Historically lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the SP 500 going forward as shown below But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20 for the first time in at least 50 weeks performance has actually tended to consistently be positive In fact across each of the past six instances the SP 500 has been higher six months

has been a rather lackluster month for the market DJIA SP 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains Historically the month has opened respectably advancing on the first and second trading days From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of midmonth Here the market rallied to create a nice midmonth bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses The brisk post midmonth drop is typically followed by a month end rally

Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade The US economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest its been since our earliest analysis in 2005 according to LPL Researchs proprietary Beige Book Barometer BBB The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserves Beige Book a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business ownerswhat we like to think of as Main Street rather than Wall Street The BBB gauges Main Streets sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text In the most recent Beige Book strong words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity but even that is a welcome shift The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVIDrelated restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick Sentiment is up and thats a great sign for the direction of the economy  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsi0wpcomlplresearchcomwpcontentuploads2021066321BlogChart1pngssl1 This was an important Beige Book in other ways Mentions of COVIDrelated words virus COVID pandemic fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book when the words first started to appear More concerning words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis The downside of the economys rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand which can ramp up quickly and supply which comes on line more slowly while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening Overall the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary while we expect reopening to be enduring There is still some risk around variants however and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter but theres still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets which are forward looking and gains may not come as easily but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound  SP 500 Returns Relative to History May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that we wanted to provide an update on how current longterm returns for the SP 500 stack up relative to history The chart below compares the trailing one two five ten and twentyyear annualized total returns of the SP 500 to the SP 500s historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928 Were starting to move away from the easy comps in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows but the SP 500 is still up more than 40 over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return Over the last two years the SP 500s annualized return of 258 still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 106 On a five and tenyear basis the SP 500s annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10 All in all the last decade has been very good for US equity investors The only time period where the SP 500 has experienced belowaverage returns is at the 20year window where the 84 annualized gain clocks in at 25 percentage less than the historical average of 109  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202106060221CurrentvsAvg1png The chart below compares the SP 500s current returns over the last one two five ten and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis With mostly aboveaverage returns it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile and for most time periods the percentile rank comes in well above 50 The oneyear total return of more than 40 actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile while the twoyear return isnt far from the 90th percentile either Moving further out each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20year window and that reading isnt even close On the one hand the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors but the last 20 years havent even been mediocre  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads202106060221PercentileRank1png Throughout history many investors have always worked under the assumption that longterm returns for the equity market are about 10 History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least as the average annualized oneyear gain of the SP 500 has been well above 10 With the SP 500s current 20year annualized gain currently at just 84 though what will it take for the SP 500 to reach doubledigit gains on an annualized basis over a 20year window For an idea given the strong performance of the last ten years a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean Only time will tell but if we operate under the unlikely assumption that the SP 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years its annualized twentyyear return would top 10 for the first time since August 2008 next September After that brief period above 10 from September 2022 through March 2023 it wouldnt again top that level until February 2029 In spite of the fact that the annualized 20year return would top 10 in those two periods though it still wouldnt get as high as the historical average of 109 in either of those periods This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong they also came shortly after one of the worst tenyear periods for US equities on record  CLICK HERE FOR THE CHARThttpsmediabespokepremiumcomuploads20210606022120YearReturn1pngHere are

plan and when some first idea doesnt work you pivot you try different things losing even more moneyIve made a post bashing new investors for their lack of balls during red days so this is not it This is a small guide to help you cope with emotionsMarket is driven by 3 major factors1 Emotions  you can control them if you have a plan altough you cant control what the market does If there is a huge selloff and your strategy tells you to invest long term in for example utilites treat yourself and buy the dip2 Huge institutional investors Well with our amount of money even if you are in the millions you and me  we are screwed If they fart left and we go right well too bad we need to wait for a change of wind direction3 Logical valuations That is also within your area of competence You can read 510 years worth of 10Ks and decide if a company suits your methods or notThat is if you are INVESTINGThere is a HUGE HUGE difference between investing day trading swing trading and trading options investing for growth investing for value or speculationYou cant make money long term if you dont know into which group you belongI for example am investing my money LONG TERM Which means even if market dives I take my cash position and I deploy it to make more money in 23 years I reinvest every single dividend for a snowball effectI cant understand why people are joining a discussion without having any sort of fundamental information regarding investment strategy from the OPYes we see you red lines we see your winnings but tell us WHY and what for you are investing For how longIMO every post should being with1 I am XYZ type of investor2 My time frame is XYZ3 My risk tolerance is low average high4 I am using XYZ method of trading swing trading day trading long term holdingx200BWe cant have a decent sub without these type of infromation right now this is a pit where people are dumping their thoughts like shit into toilet without any freaking contextx200BSoThe planning part1 Ask yourself truly how much can you lose2 Ask yourself why are you investing3 For how long4 When to exit For example if stock is 123 fold or maybe just after 30 uptick Have that and then dont cry when you see drop from 178 gain to 13 because you never exited that position I am for example holding dividend paying stocks when one of them rises 50 I sell and I put that money into something else or I reinvest to the pie I have5 How much can you really add Are you going to DCA  dollar cost average6 Throwing around HOLD THE DIP or JUST DCA wont work for people that are in the market for a 3 year timeframe I can hold a stock for 10 years without a flinch but most people cant7 If you are uncertain use a paper account Most of the notable platforms have a form of trading virtual money Do it for a year and see if you are not bored already Its about the process a journey if you are in for a short squeeze of time just play option like in a casino and then whine about losing or brag about winning Its like giving a leash without a dog to a child to see if the child keeps walking out with the leash to make sure it can handle a dog long term8 Make sure to be up to date but dont make decisions based on inflation or the interest rate if you are a long term holder I know that inflation is a bad sing for dayswing traders because their positions and trading strategy will be harder so make sure to read up on that I dont give a damn about those things only when I buy9 I buy once a year I reinvest everything automatically to see the snowball but I make one big purchase a year It gives me time reliefs stress I can read 100s of 10Ks before I hit that purchase button because of my investing plan I am stuck with it for minimum 510 years so it better be good10 Decide if buying 10 stocks for 1000 dollars make sense IMHO it doesnt If you work with less then 10K just invest in 23 very well picked holdings it will bring more money from divs and natural growth If you purchase 15 holdings it doesnt make sense and you wont make a lot of money you will be frustrated11 If you cant invest more at a time work on yourself Get an MBA maybe do some certifications Increase your wage Dont enter the stock market to make it your main source of income without education For me it is a hobby that will last a lifetime for you it may be a chance to actually replace your normal job So educate go to local uni or a course a good course not a mentorship Even if you are 40 and driving a forklift you can go to college and you can get new education Your family should be supportive about you growing as a human beingx200BIt really doesnt matter for me what market will do in 3 hours from now it may be the biggest drop weve ever seen and I dont care I wait for a moment like that to deploy cash If you hold options day trade well hats off to you for such a high risk tolerance and congrats on high rewardsMarket is overheated tech had a huge run but it doesnt mean that we will see a huge correction any time soon Low rates are balooning the prices Diversify a little to sleep better Or not just make sure you write it down and stick to itx200BGood

beat the Wall Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings The stock skyrocketed 35 the next dayIn the first quarter the 3D printing companys revenue rose 77 year over year and 17 excluding the impact of divestitures to 1461 million Growth was driven by continued strength in the healthcare segment and a stabilizing of the industrial segment which was hard hit by the fallout

209 million or 017 per share up from a loss per share of 45 million or 004 per share in the yearago period GAAP net income was 452 million or 036 per share up from a loss of 189 million or 017 per share in the first quarter of 2020Earnings releases tell only part of the story Following are two key things from 3D Systems Q1 earnings call that investors should know1 The companys competitive advantagesFrom CEO Jeffrey Graves remarksThere are three things that inspire my confidence in our future And I believe they should inspire yours as well First we clearly by far have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry  Second Im convinced that we have the brightest and most creative application engineers in the industry Third as one of the largest and most experienced companies in the industry we have the scale and the infrastructure to not only support our customers needs when they initially implement additive manufacturing but also sustain them over the lifetime of their equipment by providing key services and consumables that are vital to their ongoing business successAs to Graves first point 3D Systems does have the broadest offerings in the 3D printing industry in terms of technology to my knowledge at least among publicly traded companies It has several polymer technologies and at least one metal 3D printing technologyFor a couple of points of comparison Rival Stratasys NASDAQ SSYS another wellestablished pureplay 3D printing company doesnt have a metal 3D printing technology Newly public Desktop Metal NYSE DM is just in the early stages of commercializing its metal technology and only recently expanded into polymers via its February acquisition of EnvisionTECHis second point about having the brightest and most creative application engineers is too subjective to addressIll also agree with Graves third point about 3D Systems having a scale and experience advantage at least relative to most other players That said theres a caveat here Under the prior two CEOs the company prematurely released products that had quality issues So while scale does usually provide various advantages it wont do so if customers are hesitant to buy a product from a company due to concerns about quality Hopefully this issue is largely behind 3D Systems but investors still need to keep an eye on it2 Ramping up its healthcare business organically and through acquisitionsFrom Graves remarksAs you can see in our numbers for Q1 were seeing rising demand for new applications particularly in our healthcare business To meet this demand forecast were expanding our Denver Colorado location by roughly 50  Through this next phase of investment  well be able to reduce time to market for new medical applications continue expanding our product offerings and better support the holistic needs of our growing healthcare customer baseIn Q1 3D Systems healthcare revenue surged 39 year over year to 725 million This segment accounted for 496 of the companys total revenue of 1461 million So its business is now essentially evenly split between healthcare and industrialAs Graves said on the prior quarters call the companys healthcare business brings a bit higher gross margin on average than our industrial business So naturally it makes great sense to focus somewhat more on applications that are more profitableIn addition 3D Systems announced several days before it released its Q1 results that it had acquired Allevi a small Philadelphiabased bioprinting company Bioprinting refers to using 3D printing technology to print animal and human cells to produce threedimensional functional tissues This was a smart move and expands the companys involvement in this space as its been collaborating with United Therapeutics NASDAQ UTHR in this realm since 2017Graves said one key intermediateterm application of bioprinting is to help pharmaceutical companies speed up the drug development process A longerterm goal of those working in this space is to print fully functional solid human organs such as the liver heart and kidneys for transplant purposes Regenerative medicine as its often called is in its infancy but it has humongous growth

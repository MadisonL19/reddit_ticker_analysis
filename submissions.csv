Submission,m4zppr,"I think some HS friends are running a stocks scam, but I’m not sure what it is. Can someone help me decipher?",ElonMuskPaddleBoard,"So there’s a bunch of guys I went to high school with. They were...pretty average students. I’m almost 100% sure none of them went to any kind of college.

But they’re recently peddling that they are all CEOs of their own investing companies. Every post is either of them engaged in some absurd level of wealth, or encouragement to join their team, or both.

Nothing adds up. The videos they share have the granularity of a Wikipedia article on “stocks” or “forex”. But they’re talking about driving Lamborghinis and buying $300k (ugly) watches. Humble-bragging about making $100k in a day on the markets. They also have official looking articles published about them as entrepreneurs that are just fluff pieces full of generic garbage-positive advice. And they post random pictures or tickers here and there with zero context to their 100k followers. I’m a relatively experienced investor and I really have no idea that they are going on about.

I think it’s a scam. Even if they did know what they were doing in the markets, why not focus on that and why put so much emphasis on displaying their wealth and getting others to join?  All they talk about is mentors. It has all the looks of trying to sell a lifestyle....all the actual millionaires I know wear $20 jeans and drive Honda’s and spend zero time bragging about how much they made or what their strategy is.

Is this some kind of scam? I’ve been looking but I can’t find any information about this, but I have friends that I care about that are looking to join. I just want to know what the point of this scam is so I can try to keep the ones I care about away from it. Thanks in advance.

**Edit**: thank you for some of the helpful insight. For those calling me a moron/idiot - I got thrown off Ponzi because I thought that was more about taking money and not mentoring, and I got thrown off mlm because even though there’s recruiting I thought mlms had to at least pretend to peddle a “product” of some kind like Amway. I know it’s a scam, but the mentor part threw me off and googling the wrong keywords wasn’t helping. Sorry I’m not brilliant as you all are, best of luck in your perfect endeavors.",,639,t3_m4zppr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4zppr/i_think_some_hs_friends_are_running_a_stocks_scam/,2299,0.92,[1615743393.0]
Submission,m4uv8i,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021",bigbear0083,"Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
> Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
> The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
> The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> # Fed ahead
> “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
*****
> He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
> Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
> That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
> Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
*****
> It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
> “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
*****
> “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
*****
> Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
> # Growth vs. cyclicals
> Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
> Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
> “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
> “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
*****
> Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
> “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”
*****
> The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
> “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”
*****
> “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”
*****
> Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.
*****
> “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.
*****
> # Bond volatility
> There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
> The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
> The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
> The program expires March 31.
*****
> “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.
*****
> “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”
*****
> Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
> “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”

> # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

> Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

> March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. S&P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.

> # Signs of Life in Europe?

> Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

> Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

> While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”

> For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

> # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&P 500 & Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

> We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.

> There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

> The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

> This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

> However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

> # Versatile Outperformers

> There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

> Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week and month ahead r/stocks.",,110,t3_m4uv8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4uv8i/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,457,0.98,[1615726584.0]
Submission,m4zabk,My Take on Semiconductors - TSMC DD,datamonkeyz,"Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!

The market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. 

There are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.

The producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. 

Between Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. 

That said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. 

TLDR: We need more chips. TSM makes the best chips.",,88,t3_m4zabk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4zabk/my_take_on_semiconductors_tsmc_dd/,157,0.94,[1615742166.0]
Submission,m50u8p,$CODX moving ⬆️!,Scared_Patience_4802,"$CODX is still a hidden gem! Totally undervalued. It closed after hours at $14 and WSJ has its price target at $43! Dropped with the market from over $20 a few weeks ago, finally began moving again and started squeezing out the shorts this week after they announced a partnership with Walgreens for their new patented rapid-covid saliva tests. 

Also- $CODX has earnings in a few weeks and it’s from the best quarter ever thanks to the sales of the other covid tests they sell. Shorts are beginning to cover which shot it up 20% from last weeks opening price. Last I saw though about 90% of shorts still haven’t covered yet. 

Earnings is estimated the last week of March so I purchased about 75 of the 4/16 $30 calls for about $.70, crazy how cheap they are! Also picked up a few $29 and $30 calls for 3/19 for fun on Friday, paid $.10. All on top of my 175 shares. 

Definitely check it out! I’ve been holding my 175 shares since $8 in January and I’m not selling till at least $40!

Submission,m4j2cb,Do people with more capital have an advantage over people with less capital when it comes to trading?,ExpensivePumpkin6,"I'm still new and trying to learn but I was curious about this. Say person A has $100,000 that he can execute a trade with, compared to person B who can only put $10,000 into one trade, can the former person leverage their situation to make more profit? I know hedge funds can cause massive fluctuations in price but I'm talking about retail investors who might be a bit on the wealthier side and can exit a position quicker than a hedge fund.

One example I can think of is low-volume stocks. If person A shorted that low volume stock with their 100k, wouldn't they be able to cause a relatively large drop in price since the volume is low and their capital can short a lot of shares? What about vice versa?

Submission,m4yyvz,How to invest $180k with mental block from huge losses,ClosetPervy,"Long story short, I was stupid enough to sell at the bottom of March last year and is still in 100% cash. The cash had been sitting in my brokerage earning 0% interest for the past year. I am in Canada and the cash are sitting in a RRSP hence i did not transfer it into a interest bearing account because I wanted the cash to remain liquid in a event of a crash. I kept hoping the market would crash so I could buy back in cheaper and that has cost me 2 years of my salary in missed gains. Seeing these gigantic rallies every day I am getting serious FOMO but is also conflicted as buying back in now will be locking in my losses. I dont think I have the mental strength to hold on to all cash much longer and I know I shouldn't of tried to time the market in the first place but I feel I'm in too deep at this point. I feel like doing a lump sum and be done with it  so i can be free from my mental anguish but with markets at ATH i am still somewhat hesitant, I don't want to FOMO in at the top and see my holdings crash. Would DCA be a better option? 

100K of this money is actually for my parents' retirement. They will be retiring within 5-8 years. I sold their 2% MER mutual fund last year and wanted to buy back the ETF equivalent but because of my greediness I wanted to time the bottom and to buy in cheaper and the market just kept shooting up and i never bought in. The mutual fund allocation was 60/40 equity/fixed income and I was thinking to mirror that but seeing how much bonds are taking a beating and with potential further increases in interest in the near future I'm not sure if bonds are a good idea. I don't think I'm comfortable in going with an all equity allocation either due to my parent's short time horizon, can anyone suggest some alternatives?

I know i fucked up huge and probably shouldn't be doing DIY investing. But please, I am already feeling dead inside. Missing the greatest bull market in history will most likely haunt me for the remainder of my life.  I will never touch the holdings again once fully invested. Would just like some advice on how to put my parent's money back into the market.",,98,t3_m4yyvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4yyvz/how_to_invest_180k_with_mental_block_from_huge/,37,0.73,[1615741246.0]

Submission,m4meb2,What are your thoughts on Salesforce (CRM),augustusbennius,"Been watching CRM for about a week. Did some digging on the stock because the price is 25% below it’s 52 wk high right now.

I’m not sure how to feel. Most of the articles I’ve read only offer one sentence type explanation for why the price is down so much. So I thought it’d be cool to ask y’all.

Bear Case:

- It has a ~50 P/E which is super high for a value stock but maybe average for a tech growth stock. 

- Up about 40% 1 year (Reference SP500 is up ~50% and QQQ is up ~70%)

- TA shows pretty clear 6 month bearish channel 

- Bond yields rising so growth stocks are taking a hit. CRM down ~12% (reference QQQ down ~6%)

Bull Case:

- Goldman just moved CRN into their conviction but category. The average analyst rating implied an upside of ~20%.  

- CRM seems to be a dominant leader in CRM and SaaS. 

- Has grown revenue ~30% YoY. Super crazy profit margins (don’t remember exact numbers but ~ 60%). Very low debt and asset/liabilities.


I should note that my source for the second point in the Bull case is from a couple YouTube videos and articles I’ve looked at; I’m not an expert so I wasn’t able to make sense of Salesforce lead in CRM or SaaS yet.

But yeah. Wondering what y’all think.

I'm not suggesting people commit tax fraud but this seems like an easy loophole. I'm not from the US and I'm not familiar with the tax code but I'm genuinely curious. You could invest for your child's education, then gift them the shares and have them sell it right away to pay for their tuition with minimal taxes. It can be done with any family members as well.

Could someone who is experienced with this explain if it's actually possible?


Edit: So I misunderstood. You don't pay gift taxes as long as it's less than 15k per year. Anything on top of that must be reported and goes to your lifetime allowance of up to 11 million tax free but anything under 15k doesn't need to be reported at all and doesn't affect the 11 million limit. However, you still pay taxes on the gains from the stock if you sell it as if you were the one who bought it all along.

Submission,m4wo0z,How much of my portfolio should be ETF,jcough10,"Ok relatively new to investing. I am 32 and previously have just had a 401k for about 6 years.  I took about 10 grand and opened an account that I have been slowly buying stocks with. So far I had only about 5k invested. 50% in AAPL, AMZN DIS and 50% in APHA and CHPT.

Basically I am looking to but the remaining 5k into EFT. I figured this would have me at 25% Growth stocks, 25% value stocks and 50% EFT.  The EFTs I am planning to buy (likely next week) are ARKF, ARKF and PRNT (not 100% sure about PRNT yet). Is this a good portfolio model to follow? I plan on adding about 4K-6k a year for now as well as diversifying more.

Submission,m4iaqz,Triterras $TRIT DD,Dinosaur279,"**Summary**

* Triterras is a global trade finance company that is using blockchain technology to bring financing opportunities to parties with who banks do not want to work with due to increased regulations and thus lower margins with traditional systems.
* Recent price action is due to accusations of fraud in a short report which caused a 50% price drop.
* My belief is that many of the allegations are not substantive, and the ones I haven't dismissed are highly speculative.
* Recent events have added support to the companies reliability and future growth and have, in my opinion, resolved the worry of fraud.
* Recent filings show the short float might suddenly jump from 36% to 45%-50% due to a decrease in the float.
* If this is the case, then a strong price reversal is imminent.

**Company Overview** 

[Triterras](https://triterras.com/) is hoping to address the market of small and medium-sized companies who do global trade but who do not work with large enough supplies to qualify for traditional financing with banks. This is largely due to new stricter regulations to protect the parties involved. Such regulations are beneficial in avoiding cases of fraud, but make it less worthwhile for banks to work with companies who don't make enough money to qualify the increased effort and thus lower profit margins on the bank's side.

Triterras is using blockchain technology to more efficiently provide financing whilst still meeting the new regulatory requirements. They're not the only company trying to do this, but they're the one who is furthest ahead. They are also largely focused on bringing traders to the platform, fully aware of the fact that the network effect is both the greatest hurdle and greatest advantage in situations like this.

**What happened?**

A couple of short reports ([A](https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-triterras-trit)) ([B](https://phase2partners.egnyte.com/dl/bZMK5uwx27/)) were released with accusations of fraud. The former is relatively speculative, but it has been shared on Reddit before so I included it. Many of the concerns seem far-fetched, especially given the renewed support recently (discussed later). The later report is far more detailed. Many of the accusations are directly discussed in Triterras's [announcement](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/triterras-company-statement-in-response-to-short-report) and have in fact already been brought up by the SEC in an earlier [form](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-033318/). Obviously, Triterras didn't provide as much of an answer as I would have liked, but again I think many of the accusations are speculative. A seeking alpha article provided a very thorough look into the situation and much of the comments section furthered the discussion with really valuable perspectives (written by 1035 Capital Management, I cannot link the article per sub rules). I highly recommend reading through all of these resources in full.

As a result of these reports, the share price fell from the $11-$14 range to the $6-$8 range. I believe a large number of short positions were taken out during this time, see [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/TRIT) and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/trit). The current shares shorted is around 8 million shares with a float of around 24 million shares.

**Recent Events**

Recently, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/37/triterras-announces-strategic-partnership-with-western) a partnership with Western Union, a massive leader in money transfers and financial services. The description of the partnership provides renewed support in Triterras being a sound company with a hopeful future. 

Moreover, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/38/triterras-signs-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-invoice-bazaar) the intent to purchase Bazarr, furthering the regional expertise of the company and providing renewed support for future growth.

**Institutional Ownership and Buyback**

Here is where things get a bit more speculative. With the drop in share price, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/triterras-authorizes-50-million-share-repurchase-program) a $50 million dollar buyback. The verbiage used is 

*""Triterras’ recent share price has created an attractive opportunity for the company to institute a stock repurchase program. The Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may or may not be conducted through 10b5-1 plans.""* 

The key is that the buyback may be done through privately negotiated transactions, remember this.

Looking at the holders on [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRIT/holders?p=TRIT), we can see that Fidelity owns a large number of shares through both FMR LLC and Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunity Fund (I'll call them FAGOF, lol). On 02/08 they submitted a [SC 13G form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001327/) to the SEC detailing their new positions (this data is not accounted for on yahoo finance yet). We see that FMR LLC's position is essentially unchanged, while FAGOF more than doubled their position, from 2.2 to 5 million shares. A month later, on 03/10, they submitted another [SC 13G/A form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001436/) detailing their new position. Now, we see that FMR LLC owns only 56 shares. During that time, the share price was around $7. That brings the value of their position during that time to around $50-$60 million. Now the trading volume during that time was only a couple million a day, and we see a steady decline from mid-February to late-February. So, and here's the speculative part, my belief is that FMR LLC sold a majority of their position to Triterras as part of the $50 million buyback previously mentioned. The remaining shares were slowly liquidated from mid-February to late-February.

But wait, why would FMR LLC sell all their shares, especially when the price was so low? Well first, so far as I can tell, we don't know what they paid for those shares. It's entirely possible they still made a profit even at this price point. In general, I imagine, Funds like these don't like to participate in stocks that are so crazy volatile and not super reliable. Triterras is a growth company, and the recent news and everything going crazy may have encouraged Fidelity to back out of the craziness. On the other hand, Fidelity's fund focused on growth, FAGOF, which can take the volatility and risk, more than doubled their stake.

Let's assume that 6-8 million shares of FMR LLC's position were sold directly to Triterras through an off-market deal. Triterras already said this was an option, and FMR wouldn't want to trade that many shares on the open market with such a low average volume since it would tank the price. That means the buyback is complete, and the float is now around 16-18 million shares. Further, this means the short float, which was 36%, is now around 45%-50%. Also, right now, the daily volume is low, so the days to cover is around 3, according to the latest [short interest report](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/trit/short-interest).

**Now What?**

Well, if the accusations are true, then the company will probably go bye-bye, or at least get another drop and take a while to recover or just fizzle away into nothingness. But, if instead, the accusations are false or insignificant, then I expect a good price reversal. The current price is only depressed because of the belief in the accusations. So, with a renewed sense in the companies outlook, and a potential 50% short float, the price could easily go back to its past levels or higher.

**Closing Remarks and My Position**

I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter. I didn't go into many specifics about the short reports, especially the analysis of the actual blockchain transactions in report B. If anyone here is familiar with the data I'd love to hear your opinion.

I currently have a few short, medium, and long-term call contracts and a handful of shares. And of course, this is not financial advice and I am not encouraging you to buy this stock. I'm sharing my findings and am eager for feedback on things to reconsider.",,9,t3_m4iaqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4iaqz/triterras_trit_dd/,15,0.83,[1615677975.0]

Submission,m5220x,"I want to like Lemonade LMND - but I just can't. DD, prove me wrong please!",chi3fer,"I've been a happy customer of lemonade and think they have a great business model acquiring younger people that don't want to interact with people and have an easy and intuitive way to buy renters and homeowners insurance.  Demographics will progress as millennials age. 

I bought lemonade a couple years ago for renters insurance and am now buying my first house and will utilize them for homeowners.  Both times I had GREAT experiences. Easy to interact. No phone calls and they even worked with my lender to show proof of insurance without me really asking.  I was also able to add ring insurance to my renters with relative easy witch is a bit difficult when it comes to valuation and coverage. 

So lemonade dips hard and I'm like go time. I listened to the podcast Dave Lee with the Lemonade CFO and it I like where they were heading and the CEO just recently ""leaked"" that they'd be adding a new product which has to be car insurance.  I like where they are heading BUT...

If you look at the insurance space it is sooo crowded. Additionally if you look at Google's interest overtime  lemonade doesn't come close to the big boys progressive, all state, geico etc.

Lemonade is still unprofitable for the foreseeable future and while their cost to acquire is much less. I don't think people want to actively switch insurance unless they absolutely have to. Similar to banks it's just a pain in the ass especially if you are tied down with multiple products. This is why the bundle and save is around to make the company/product super sticky and hard to get out of even if you have a bad experience. 

I'd love to hear some counter points because I want to invest in this company due to my experience but there is no moat and I hate how many players with massive ad spend and brand recognition are in the game.",,18,t3_m5220x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m5220x/i_want_to_like_lemonade_lmnd_but_i_just_cant_dd/,11,0.69,[1615749879.0]

Submission,m528ce,Inflation play,cookiekid6,"Everyone is talking about the best inflation hedges and I was thinking REITs could be the best inflation plays out there. Specifically I was thinking about investing in macerich company. Malls are seriously undervalued as of now. One of the biggest concerns about this company is the debt it has and obviously with inflation debt becomes less of an issue. Mac owns prime real estate and class A malls which is a great asset with inflation because there is only a finite amount of land available. Class A malls mean that these are high valued malls and the land is still valuable because of their location. Obviously malls are on the decline but this is a value play for repurposing their land. Macerich is heavily shorted and the price has been pushed down by shorts. This is not a short squeeze play but a long term play. Macerich is in the works of repurposing their malls to add apartments and medical centers to attract people. Coincidentally closing of malls means less competition for the better malls which macerich owns. I believe that the market thinks commercial real estate in big cities are dead but I just cannot see working from home being as productive as being in an actual office and I believe that the need to meet in person and in cities will still be necessary.

Submission,m4rgzs,My way into investing so far - loss 5%,Bunniesinpink,"Hello and good sunday morning :)

This will probably be a long post, but then you can kill some time before market opens monday :D

I'm pretty new to investing, I got into it about 1 month ago. I'm trying to read up TA and FA, i'm not sure witch one I like the best tho. But I think maybe FA is best for beginner.

I have read, that I should try to diversify my portofolio and I have tried to do that. But those say, that it is best to only have a few stocks, when no investing more capital than I have. As said I went with diversify a bit, but meh that seems to have gone a bit wrong.

My portofolio so far is:

\- **Apple (AAPL)** \- 26 stocks - buyin price 123,15$ - my plan is very long hold on this one. Reason for buying. I liked the entery price, and I think for many years they will still be one of dominant players in phone market.

\- **Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo - SABESP (SBS)** \- 156 stocks - buyin price 7.67$ - My plan is long hold. Reason for buying. It is a water company so I saw this as a rater safe stock, as ppl will need water both now and in future.

\- **Corsair Gaming, Inc. (CRSR)** \- 60 stocks - buyin price 47,98$ auch - This one been expensiv learning lesson. With current price at 34$ this might turn into a very long hold. The reason for buying is I think they have oki position in market, and even tho that ppl will spend less time on gaming, once the world opens up, then I still think that new ppl have opened their eyes for gaming while being at home.

\- **Crayon Group Holding ASA (CRAYN.OL)** \- 125 stocks - buyin at 141.25 NKK - Plan to hold semi long. Reason for buying is that even tho I bought at high price, I still think that there is room for growth.

\- **Daimler AG (DAI.DE)** \- 25 stocks - buyin price 66,5 euro - Plan to hold untill start 2022. Reason for buying is that I wanted a luxury brand in portofolio, and I want to learn and see what happens when/if they but the truck division on the stockmarket.

\- **Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)** \- 60 stocks - buyin 43,22$ - Plan is to sell soon, cause I'm up 15% in this one. I had hoped for the world to be more open, but I think 2021 will also be a bad year for airliners. If business travel goes down in comming years, and with more debt added to the company, I think it is time to run. Reason for buying was, that I had hoped for a return to ""normal"" in spring, but looks like it will be longer.

\- **Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DBK.DE)** \- 125 stocks - buyin price 10,72 euro - Plan is to hold for 3-5 years. Reason for buying, is I wanted a bank in portofolio too, and was looking around and thought that this one could be oki. It has a name and pretty big and they are in the mid of a turn around. They have completed 85% of the turn around goals set out in 2019 and the golas should be done in 2021/2022, so I think they are on the right track.

\- **Norway Royal Salmon AS (NRS.OL)** \- 55 stocks - buyin price 202,42 NKK - Plan is to hold for 1-2 years max. Reason for buying I think there is more room for growing and with new factories opening up and with restaurants opening up later this year, I think will be positive for them.

\- **Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)** \- 25 stocks - buying price 29,09$ - plan is for long hold on this one. Reason for buying not really any, was looking for a tech stock and this one was talked about alot.

\- **Pfizer Inc. (PFE)** \- 70 stocks - buying price 34,91@ - Plan is to hold till the annual report for 2021 and then dicide what to do with it. Reason for buying guess a stable company and was interested in seeing how the vaccines will influence them.

Overall i'm down about 5% for this roughly last month since I started. Still have some cash that I need place in something.

**My investment profile**

My investment profile is mostly semi long to long. While I do try to keep up most days I feel it can be overwelming specially for a new investor, so I plan to revisit and look over my stocks like every quarter and see if I want to change something. This portofolio is for pure investing, retirement account that hold bonds, etfs, stocks etc, I don't consider that account ""investing"" but more a passiv thing. So what I want to learn with this one portofolios is to look for ""bargins"" and companies I believe in.

**My plan for idle cash/shortlist**

I still think prices on many stocks are high, so I'm not sure if to put rest of money that atm is idle in the account into more stocks.

On my list of stock to maybe buy is:

\- **Hugo Boss AG (BOSS.DE)** \- I think when ppl can return to shops, they might get a high sale.

\- **Halliburton Company (HAL)** \- With olie prices up and it looks like Texas might open fully up, maybe this one, could be a bet if not buying BP, Chevon etc.  
\- **Index fonds** with focus on the european markets - if the US is ""overpriced"" compared to EU-markets then this could be option I think.  
\- **Essity AB (publ) (ESSITY-B.ST)** \- Is a women personal care mostly, and with ppl going out more women also needs more personal care products :)

**My questions are the following:**

\- Is my portofolio totally messed up?  
\- Would you cut down on number of companies and put the money from the sell off into the other stocks that is left after sell off?  
\- Is it oki to discuss european stocks here? I mostly see US stocks - that is great cause gives me information about the US stock market. I'm from Europe (DK), so sometime I miss talks about european stocks.  
\- When I started to buy the stocks I thought the prices on nearly all stocks were very high and was a bit scary of jumping into investing, but with the negativ rates in the bank, I though was better to invest. But in times like this when stockmarket is really high, is it then oki to be mostly semi-long to long, or is it better to marke more trades and taking small profits?  
\- How did you get started? Reading books? Podcasts? YT?  
\- Have you ever doubted your trades and how did you handel it? Sometimes when I see red numbers I feel like I suck at it, and to affraid to cut losses, is there a way to overcome the feeling and say enough is enough, let me just sell and move on?  
\- Based on my investment profile and shortlist/plan - do you have other recomendations? (the markets I can trade on is US, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway)

Submission,m530yu,Better to take on debt than to sell off stocks?,Jasonmv222,"I first started investing in 2016 with the sole intent of having somewhere to park my money for a chance to grow while waiting for the next big purchase (car/house). No real research other than googling “best etf for 2016/17/18/etc.” When it came time to make the purchase, I’d cash out, and I did that ($30k) in 2018 for a down payment on our first house. 

I’ve since rebuilt my portfolio to $80k and growing, and up until this year my intent in investing remained the same. The plan was that the next time we had to buy a new car, it would be a full cash purchase, or the next time we had to buy a home (military/frequent moves), I’d cash out my portfolio and add it to the equity I’ve built on my current home for an even bigger down payment on the next. And on and on repeating the cycle of rebuilding my brokerage account from scratch with the ultimate goal of as close to full cash purchase as possible on our forever home after my 20 years in the military (in 8-9 years).

I’m wondering if this is a bad idea. My portfolio is up $20K over the last year. When it’s time to look at upgrading one of our cars, for example, is it better to take on a 3% apr car loan than to sell off half of my portfolio? When it comes time for the next house purchase, would it be wise to liquidate everything for as large of a down payment as possible, knowing we very likely won’t be in this next house longer than 5 years? 

Watching my portfolio grow at this rate has really sucked me in to wanting to learn more and more about investing, and a growing part of me wants to keep throwing money into it vs making large down payments.",,30,t3_m530yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m530yu/better_to_take_on_debt_than_to_sell_off_stocks/,8,0.76,[1615752512.0]

Submission,m4w0gs,GoodRX (GDRX) - is a GOOD long-term investment,pandatears420,"On Friday (3/12/2021) GDRX fell sharply, at one point close to 14%. It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years.

Some say it’s the worst of times, others say it’s the best of times. 


My PERSONAL opinion is that, it’s the BEST of times

Why? Because it’s not like that countries and people will be looked forever. The population has not decreased, a drone airlines has not been suddenly invented. So of course people will soon be traveling again . And maybe more than EVER. Because I think that the appetite for travel will be immense in the coming months and years.

One,s loss is others gain, They say.

All airlines in the world has suffered, also in Europe, and specially in Norway. One of the best low cost airlines (Norwegian) in Europe of the past decade have had huge problems. Their bankruptcy issue is still not settled, they have canceled and reduced their fleet, are on the verge of more share dilution etc etc. 

Source.  https://www.google.dk/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/norwegian-air-updates-offer-creditors-080158464.html

Norwegian,s loss,? FLYR AS gain ?


Here comes FLYR AS. This new starter , I believe has huge potential. But can also be risky. 

First the potential 



1. FLYR AS board members are former Norwegian people.

Tonje Wikstroem Frislid, a former Norwegian Air executive.

Brede Huser, former director Norwegian Reward

Thomas Ramdahl, former commercial director Norwegian

Asgeir Nyseth, former operations director Norwegian

Alf Sagen, has long experience in Norwegian 

Bjørn Erik Barman-Jenssen, former chief for ground services and cargo in Norwegian

Tord Meling, has experience from Deloitte and many years in Norwegian, as a chief for airplanes financing.

https://e24.no/naeringsliv/i/LnA551/erik-g-braathen-i-allianse-med-tidligere-norwegian-topper-starter-nytt-norsk-flyselskap

2. FLYR is, I believe DEBT FREE, very positive if true. couldn’t find source.

3. Their timing is very good ,considering how cheaply they can lease planes at the moment. The whole airlines market has been struck like never before. Customer vise I believe they have to start over maybe. Almost a complete standstill.

4. On their website you can see, that they are looking for pilots, and other crew members. Great timing for hiring.

https://career.flyr.no/jobs

Osm Aviation have began recruiting pilots for them. Translate via google 

https://e24.no/boers-og-finans/i/56R4jm/osm-aviation-rekrutterer-piloter-for-flyr

5. There plan is to begin flying in the summer

https://www.flyr.no/en

Currently FLYR AS provides travel solutions, it offers booking, check-in, boarding,changing the time or adding luggage details as per convenient on mobil. 





The risky part.

1. they are a new company.

2.They don’t have a LICENSE yet.

3.They still have to establish them selves in the market. 

4. They don’t have a fleet yet. 



Conclusion: FLYR stock has huge potential, let’s say they are granted license, stock goes up.  

They announce leasing of planes, stock goes up, they announce the distinctions they,ll be flying to, stock goes up, they put ticket for sale , stock goes up, they make their first flight , stock goes up etc etc. huge potential.

Of course their are risks, imagine they get denied a license, stock goes way way down.

But I am not an expert to know can they be denied license, and why, and how can that be known before it happens?  

It is a NORWEGIAN company, not a third world/Chinese scam company.

Submission,m4y1iu,SUMO - Sumo Logic Inc.,Brecken79,"SUMO Logic Inc: SUMO Logic went public in September for $22.00 a share. The stock dipped as low $16.71 on October 26th, 2021, before their first earnings report on December 7th (Posted in detail below), after which shares pumped to a high of $46.37 by February 8th. SUMO’s analysts ratings are excellent, analyst coverage is largely solid, and despite offering softer than expected guidance amid their most recent earnings, little has changed as far as their prospects for high growth. Of course, I see many companies this earnings season claiming “uncertainty” as a result of underlying economic conditions. More often than not I assess they’re simply managing expectations so that they can continue overperforming analysts predictions.

SUMO guidance expects between $53.2M & $54.2M in revenue for the quarter ending this upcoming April, a return of 13-15% and an adjusted loss of 12 cents a share. Consensus analysts estimates called for $53.4M and a loss of 14 cents per share. Overall they expect to grow in revenue between $231-$235M by JAN2022, an increase of 14-16% YoY, while expecting an EPS loss of 40-50 cents a share (I believe this an extreme low ball assessment). Analysts expect $234.1M and a YoY adjusted loss of 51 cents per share by JAN2022. In all they’re beating their earnings and growing slightly faster than analysts expectations, although the street seems to expect much higher growth. And of course, so do I. In FY 2018 they had $68M in revenue. In FY 2019 they grew to $103M in revenue, and by FY 2020, $155.06M. In the year ending in JAN2021 they gained $202.6M.

I do not believe, given this company’s record and clientele, that they’re going to grow less than their expected rate. And while some critics believe that this space is overcrowded, I look through their growing list of customers and see some solid names. This is not likely to slow for SUMO any time soon and I am optimistic that their revenue may grow well beyond their YoY guidance. In short, little has changed to justify such a massive over-reaction (Remember they reported amid the market correction time frame) to their most recent earnings beat, and with COVID coming to an end, I expect revenue growth to be much higher than their lowball guidance. I see SUMO stock as oversold, I assess this three month low as a bullish set up, and I think it a great dip buying opportunity that only comes around once in a blue moon. This is why I am long SUMO, and as a result, I have set up a covered strangle to take advantage of recent volatility. If you’re into stock I recommend investing safely and slowly as recommend in THIS STRATEGY.

1. Picking one or a couple ETFs and throwing it all in now. (Very uncomfortable with this at ATH) I’ve considered protective puts with this approach but the price of those really eats into any profits
2. Throw a portion of it in now and leave some cash to buy if/when it dips.
3. Make purchases periodically to average in over a select timeline and sticking to it.
4. Buying Leaps of the ETFs I choose to capture some gains while preserving cash to buy if it goes south. I was thinking if I had money to buy 2000 shares I’d buy 20 ITM leaps.

I don't believe it will go that low anytime soon, but I guess you never know.

If it did though, to me if rather add more shares "" at a discount"" than sell I guess.



Anyways the cons I can see is that since its held in taxable, I will incur some short term gains, but that may be better than losing ( maybe temporarily) though some principle amount.

Would someone with a relatively long term horizon need a stop loss?

So do you set it typically above your cost basis or at some number below that where ""you don't want to lose anymore money"" , for example.

Wouldn't most long term buy hold type investors just ride it to the bottom or say 70% of your principle amount or something?

Then if the stop loss does trigger, you have to make the decision when or if to buy back in.  What if it shoots right back up way over your stop loss?

Submission,m4q0r4,AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader,elvita12345,"# Overview 

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites ADA and WCAG accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, GameStop, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)

* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $210 Million
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they’re in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain.

Submission,m55z5a,Amazon CC or PMCC? What am I missing?,Scary_Ad4270,"I'm new to options investing and I need advice.

I've been selling covered calls on AMZN, usually with a .20 Delta, and making around 1500/week in premium.

I love the big premium and I'm looking to get more.

If the CC option is ever exercised, I think it makes sense to buy some LEAPS options on AMZN and sell PMCCs.

Here's my reasoning:

100 shares of AMZN costs (roughly) $300,000 and a weekly CC sells for (roughly) $1500

Three (JAN 2023) LEAPS with an 80 Delta costs (roughly) $300,000. And writing three covered calls against the three LEAPS would bring in $4500.

Seems like the 3 LEAPS will earn more in premium each week compared to the covered calls. I am bullish on AMZN shares going up in value by 2023. In addition to the juicy premium, the LEAPS options would be more valuable as the stock price goes up, right?

This sounds too good to be true, so what am I missing?

TL,DR: Looks like I can make higher weekly premiums selling PMCCs on my LEAPS instead of Traditional CCs. How am I wrong?",,1,t3_m55z5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m55z5a/amazon_cc_or_pmcc_what_am_i_missing/,3,0.81,[1615760814.0]

Cathie Wood buys more $BFLY

[https://cathiesark.com/arkg/trades](https://cathiesark.com/arkg/trades)

&#x200B;

I wanted to do a quick summary of the ticker $BFLY and share some of my thoughts of the emerging ultrasound technology that has been gaining traction the the medical field!

I've gotten some sentiment from others about their thoughts on BFLY and how they compare to other similar products in the Ultrasound market.  I believe people should understand the main differences and similarities of these products , so that, we can distinguish that BFLY is a superior technology to its competitors.  I believe that the Butterfly IQ is the most cost effective device in the market for small and large practices alike.

&#x200B;

**The Butterfly IQ, Handheld Machine Pros and Cons**

**PRO:** 3 in 1, device as opposed to using multiple different probes for scanning different systems.

**PRO**: Butterfly IQ is the only ultrasound transducer that can preform ""whole body imaging"" which a **ONE** probe as opposed to multiple different probes.

Other devices including the Clarius 2 and Lumify use crystals inside of the different various probes for different medical uses.  Traditional Probes are more fragile and can be easily damaged if dropped.

**PRO:** The Butterfly has semiconducter/microchip technology allows for 2-D array of 9000 microsensors to emulate any type of probe i.e. Linear, Curved, or phased.

I've heard ""Why would I buy a cheaper product for medical imaging?""  The materials are cheaper to make than the crystals in traditional probes which significantly lowers the cost for health care providers.

**PRO:** Butterfly Cloud  Seamless importing, exporting, and sharing of Ultrasound scans

One of the most important part of Ultrasound imaging is the image quality.  One of downsides to the Butterfly is that it is a new technology and is still in the process of improving its image quality.  Clarius V2  and Lumify have superior quality, but when comparing to the price, this makes sense.

**PRO**: AVG Price of Butterfly products/services: \~$2500 w/ a $420 annual membership, easier to roll out to 3rd world countries that need Ultrasound imaging for various medical reasons.

**PRO:** Ergonomic and 2 Hour scanning time.

**PRO:** Android and Apple IOS compatible

**PRO:**  Very easy presets for different systems of the body to examine.

**PRO:** Highly Assessible Support team

**CONS:** Wired, imaging quality not as good as the other handheld devices, New firmware, potential cord damage, non removable battery/battery drain.

&#x200B;

**Product Comparisons:**

**Clarius V2 Pros and Cons:**

Pros: Good Image quality, Wireless, Probe Controls, up to 15Mhz, Better Spatial imaging, Compatible with Andriod and Apple, no subscription, Unlimited cloud storage, shock proof

Cons: Heavier and bigger than standard probe, not ergonomic, Expensive/high costs,$\~6000, 45-60 mins per battery( device tends to heat up), wireless connectivity issues, MANY different probes for various different applications.

Features:  [https://clarius.com/scanners/c3/specifications/](https://clarius.com/scanners/c3/specifications/), specific to the multipurpose probe.

**Lumify Pros and Cons:**

Pros: Superior Image Quality, Lightweight probes, up to 12 Mhz,Android compatible, 6 hr battery life, Ergonomic, seamless connectivity

Cons:  Expensive/high cost, \~$10,000,Wired, no IOS app, need for multiple probes for different uses, not compatible with all android devices.

Features:

[https://www.ultrasoundsupply.com/products/ultrasound-machines/philips-ultrasound/philips-lumify/#:\~:text=The%20Philips%20Lumify%20integrated%20most,range%20cart%20based%20ultrasound%20system](https://www.ultrasoundsupply.com/products/ultrasound-machines/philips-ultrasound/philips-lumify/#:~:text=The%20Philips%20Lumify%20integrated%20most,range%20cart%20based%20ultrasound%20system)

In summary, as of right now, Butterfly IQ does not produce the BEST image quality; although, I think it is the best value for smaller practices.  I do believe that this technology can easily be updated overtime with its patented microchip technology.  With firmware updates, we could start to see a demand for this product!  The cost effectiveness far outweighs the downsides of the image quality.

The demand for this type of product in 3rd world countries I believe is significant in providing practical healthcare with cost in mind.  I also believe this cost is attractive for new practices that can't afford the higher priced devices!

Submission,m4n7vj,Determining a daily market trend.,Careful_Mirror6886,"Hello, 
I recently got into trading options, day trading options.


I’m just asking for advice on what tools you guys use to determine market trends, atleast for the current day.

I trade big cap options like Tesla, apple, whatever’s moving the most.


I use the spy to help me determine how the overall market is doing , so I never buy an option against the current spy direction.


Are there other things you guys use, maybe look at nasdaq too, volatility indicators? Bond yields? 
Maybe certain technical indicators? 


Can you view an option chain a certain way to see what the market is thinking about a stock I.e. if a lot of puts are being bought? 

Maybe I should just wait for an Elon tweet and instantly buy some calls? 
 
What are your strategies?

I’m fairly new to investing (for fun; i have safe long-term stocks in another account) and yes, I got into investing for fun after the gamestop craze. I had some extra money just to play around with for now. I’ve done my research on what shorting means and still, for the life of me, cannot understand how it works. 

How would a regular everyday investor (like me) short a stock? Or is it not something that an everyday investor can do? From my understanding, it is borrowing a stock and selling it at a higher price than it would later be valued at. But is that something I would be able to do (if I wanted to)? Please ELI5.😅

I'm tempted to just transfer all my positions into VTI and stop paying attention for a few months. While I know this is probably good for my health, I'm behind on all my tech stocks after this correction, so I hate to close those positions right now. I've been selling CCs to help those tech positions, which unfortunately requires more attention to sell them at a good time.

I'm considering the following options:

1) Close my tech positions, accept those loses, move everything to VTI, and check back in a few months.

2) Keep all my positions, but stop selling CCs, and stop paying attention for a few months.

The second option will likely improve my returns, but will require more discipline to not monitor and tweak constantly.

Submission,m4yz3w,I am considering researching a moving average technical strategy.,Careful_Mirror6886,"Hello all,

I am interested in researching and conducting a moving average study on specifically Tesla. 

My plan is to go through every moving average, on the 1min - daily timeframe, and back about 100-200 days.

I would count then, each time the price approaches the MA line, how many times it reacts( shows some resistance against) , bounces ( reverses trend, atleast short terms for a playable trade) and ignores( just passes through) I would do this for every time frame.

Afterwards, I would calculate the percentage of times price reacted and bounced. Obviously then I would use the MA lines with the highest percent chance of bouncing to make a trade.

What do you guys think.

I plan on starting at 9ma count by 2 or 3 up to 50,
Then continue by 5 or 10 till I reach the 200ma 

This is because I don’t want to do every single number and as you get into higher numbers the lines start to move less and less apart.

What do you guys think, is this a good idea. Has it already been done? Is they’re a faster way to do this?

I am asking because I just don’t want to waste all of my time, if someone tells else did it, or it’s just a dumb idea I won’t even bother.

Submission,m4q6zi,The Next Tech Software Play: Acquisition-Driven Vertical Market Software?,Torlek1,"Is the next Tech software play in acquisition-driven vertical market software?

[Constellation Software may cut dividend, plans to pursue bigger deals](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-software-star-may-cut-dividend-as-it-pursues-big-deals-1.1563950)

Constellation Software (CSU) is a much younger version of Roper Technologies (ROP).  Think Berkshire Hathaway plus technology.  Also, the scope of the software offerings is broader for the former than for the latter.

This little-known Canadian play in vertical market software returned at least 3600% between mid-2010 and mid-2020.  More importantly, the stock went up *even as interest rates went up in 2016*, because all acquisition targets were already profitable and cash-flow-generating businesses, and were also bought at a discount.  In other words, all acquisitions were a corporate exercise in value investing.

In turn, this company has a little brother of its own, Canadian-based Enghouse Systems (ENGH), and has also spun out European-focused Topicus (TOI).

The earlier question isn't about any of the aforementioned companies specifically.

Is there potential for one or more ""next Constellation Softwares"" that are in the business of acquisitions for building vertical market software empires as lucrative as the above, especially as we come closer to 2023-2024 and beyond?

Submission,m506f3,Tesla FSD: Am I the only one who thinks this way?,GordonGekkoVienna,"First of all, I do not own put options on Tesla, nor do I short the stock. The following thoughts came to me when a friend told me that he felt screwed by Tesla and Elon:

In recent weeks, it has been reported that Tesla admitted in an email exchange with a Californian authority that FSD is only Level 2 and that this will not change in the near future. For several years now, you can pay 7500€ (sorry, I'm European) for ""Full Potential for Autonomous Driving"". Since Elon Musk has been announcing for years that autonomous driving would be available soon (millions of robotaxis; level 5 at the end of the year), many customers (like my friend)  naturally buy this to be able to be there right from the start.

But now Tesla admits in these emails that this function will not work in the near future and that FSD is only level 2. Many people bought this system for a lot of money because Elon keeps promising that it will be available soon, although he knows very well that Tesla is still far away from it.

I would honestly feel cheated if I had believed Elon and therefore spent such a large sum of money on a driving assistant, believing it would be a fully autonomous car next year.

It's one thing not to take things too seriously, or sometimes to create somewhat high expectations, but in this case the customer is being actively deceived. It is not ok that Elon makes his customers pay for something that is not yet in sight by convincing them that it will be next year.

Also 68 million shares shorted on Friday alone. I believe after the close it went to 550,000 short shares available to lend so they had started to cover.

But then I cashed out and missed out the entire tech rally, because I just couldn't guess the direction the market was headed next. I started trading again just a few months ago, mostly swing trading and scalping some gains from WSB frenzy and hype stocks, nothing too crazy tho.

Anyways, I strongly believe that we're in a massive stock bubble, the likes of which we've never seen before. All time retail investor activity, news networks covering stocks 24/7 and the US economy, etc.

I'm curious about some of your financial plans are in terms of investing in the stock market. Are you holding? going cash gang until the storm settles? investing back in a few months when the economy opens back up and the interest rate returns to normal?

I myself, believe the upside is very limited from this point on. I wouldn't mind missing out 10\~20% gains this year if I can avoid losing 30%+ from a major market crash/correction. Just wanted share my view and where I stand. I'd also like to hear what your plans and reasons for such strategy.

As for me, I was thankfully all cash before the last 2 weeks of major correction, and will most likely be holding cash for a while until I see a clear trend, even if I catch the last tail end of it to mitigate my loss potential.

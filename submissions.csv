Submission,n7eybf,96% of US users opt out of app tracking in iOS 14.5 - Some of the first data on user behavior exceeds advertisers' worst fears.,Karnes,"""It seems that in the United States, at least, app developers and advertisers who rely on targeted mobile advertising for revenue are seeing their worst fears realized: Analytics data published this week suggests that US users choose to opt out of tracking 96 percent of the time in the wake of iOS 14.5.

When Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.

The change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.

Nonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.""

Submission,nqk7qi,AMC to Offer Free Popcorn and Exclusive Screenings for Investors,rgujjula-csdude,"Full Article Here: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/amc-plans-to-reward-retail-investors-with-free-popcorn-and-exclusives.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/02/amc-plans-to-reward-retail-investors-with-free-popcorn-and-exclusives.html)

**On Wednesday, the movie theater chain launched a new portal on its website just for its retail investors. The site, which requires stockholders to self-identify and sign-up for the chain’s loyalty program, contains “special offers” and company updates.**

One of those special offers is a free tub of popcorn.

AMC’s retail investors have [propped up company since January](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/amcs-ceo-wants-to-use-the-meme-frenzy-as-a-springboard-for-growth.html), sending the stock up more than 1,400% in the last five months. Shares were up more than 20% in premarket trading Wednesday. 

The company said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock. The forum selected several companies that were being shorted by large hedge fund groups and decided to take action.

CEO Adam Aron has praised these investors for their support. The company delayed its annual shareholders meeting by more than a month in order to give these investors an opportunity to attend the event and “make their important voices heard.”

Aron and AMC both plan to [donate $50,000 to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/amc-ceo-adam-aron-raved-about-its-reddit-investors-on-an-earnings-call.html) — a clear nod to these new investors, who call themselves apes and refer to Aron as “Silverback.” AMC also has shifted its communication style to speak directly with shareholders via social media, including YouTube. Aron has even taken a renewed interest in Twitter, “following” hundreds of accounts tied to the “ape army.”

AMC Investor Connect is the next step in the company’s strategy of connecting with these investors. The platform provides shareholders with exclusive promotions, like free or discounted items and invitations to special screenings, as well as direct communications with Aron.

“During my five-plus year tenure as CEO at AMC, I’ve taken great pride in the relationships I have forged with AMC’s owners,” Aron said in a statement Wednesday**. “With AMC Investor Connect, that effort in relationship building will continue apace even if our shareholders now number in the millions. After all, these people are the owners of AMC, and I work for them.”**",,,1009,t3_nqk7qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nqk7qi/amc_to_offer_free_popcorn_and_exclusive/,13764,0.92,[1622635400.0]
Submission,n9a2nc,"Chipotle to hike wages, debut referral bonuses in attempt to hire 20,000 workers",Brothanogood,"Chipotle said it will increase restaurant wages resulting in a $15 average hourly wage by the end of June, as it looks to bring on 20,000 workers.

Starting pay for hourly crew members will range from $11 to $18 an hour. There are opportunities to advance to general manager positions with average annual pay of $100,000.

Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol said the current labor market is among the most challenging he's seen in his career in the restaurant industry. He cited a range of reasons including child care and a rethinking of work post-pandemic.

As the labor market heats up, Chipotle Mexican Grill announced Monday it's raising pay for restaurant workers, reaching an average of $15 an hour by the end of June.

The company has also introduced employee referral bonuses of $200 for crew members and $750 for apprentices or general managers, as it looks to recruit 20,000 new workers across the country to support its peak season and new restaurant openings.

The pay hike for new and existing restaurant workers, both hourly and salaried, will roll out over the next few weeks, with hourly crew wages starting in the range of $11 to $18 per hour. There are also opportunities to advance to a restaurateur position, which is the highest-ranking general manager, with average compensation of $100,000 a year, Chipotle said, in as little as 3½ years.

Chipotle is getting creative in its hiring initiatives. It is hosting a virtual career fair on Thursday on Discord, the social platform, that will include sessions with current employees. Other Chipotle benefits include mental health care and 401(k) plans and debt-free degrees for workers after 120 days from nonprofit, accredited universities in partnership with Guild Education.

Submission,nanrlu,I analyzed 9000+ trades made by Members of the U.S. Congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.,nobjos,"**Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a.            One Month

b.            One Quarter

c.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns made by the Congress**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|
|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|
|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**

|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\-0.48%|
|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|
|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|

If you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

Submission,nrou4z,"With wood prices so high, curiosity struck me. Why is wood so expensive and where is all the money going?",chumbawamba56,"Wood is crazy expensive right now. and most seem to believe that the cost is driven by the demand for wood. But financial statements from 4 of the top 5 companies argues another excuse. According to [Sawmill DB](https://www.sawmilldatabase.com/productiontoplist.php?continent_id=998), the top 5 production mills in the US are: West Fraser, Canfor, Weyerhaeuser, Georgia Pacific (Not PT), and Resolute forests. Since GP is not publicly traded everything I share will not include them. 

One thing I noticed with all of these companies is that in the past year their stock price has sky rocketed. 

* West Fraser: 130% 

* Canfor 180%

* Weyerhaeuser 80%

* Resolute Forest **500%**

Why is their price doing this? it isn't like wsb is simping over it. 

Looking at all of their filings for the SEC tells you exactly why their price has jumped. it will also tell you why the price of wood has also skyrocketed. and it isnt a jump in demand that caused their price to raise or the price of wood to raise. These companies are just selling them for higher prices and pocketing the excess profit.

There are 4 data points that support the artificial jump in prices. Inventories, Sales, COGS, and New Earnings. below is the data for all 4 companies. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**West Fraser**


:) | Q1.2021 | Q1.2020 | increase of

Inventories | 1,137,000,000 | 735,000,000 | 21%
Sales | 2,343,000,000* | 890,000,000 | 163%
COGS | 1,039,000,000 | 630,000,000 | 65%
Selling, G and A | 78,000,000 | 41,000,000 | 90%
Net Earnings | 665,000,000 | 9,000,000(no this is not a typo) | **7289%**

*their acquisition of norbord was 707,000,000 of that unfortunately COGS for it isn't available. 

West Fraser has seen a jump in net earnings of over 7k percent. In one year they grew their net earnings by over 72x. COGS only increased by 65% which means the price of lumber or getting the lumber hasn't changed. This jump in COGS is likely due to Norbord. So even taking that out of the equation would mean they doubled their sales in a year. That is absolutely nuts. That is a profit margin that went from 2.4% to 66%. that is not normal, either. but we aren't done lets look at the other companies.

Net Earnings | 87,000,000 | -1,000,000 | another one turning things around


Some interesting things to point out:

* all these companies have a significant increase in profit margin. 2 of them were able to reverse their position and get positive earnings, while the other 2 were able to increase their net earnings by significant amounts. 

* in 3 of these cases, the increase in sale revenue was something to brag about. while the remaining company looks like they're geniuses for the growth they had. All of them did this with out having a huge jump in COGS. I include West Fraser in this because they acquired a company in Q1 of this year. for this reason I bet their COGS would like the same withholding their new acquisition. 

* Although ""Selling, G&A"" is not nearly as important or necessary as the others it is still necessary to show that any increase in lumber is due to labor. I assume labor is incorporated in COGS but I want to provide this for anyone reading this and wondering if they may be putting labor into a different classification. That was my first though when I saw COGS didnt jump as high as sales.

* Inventories for all companies were marginally impacted. The growth they experienced I'd say is probably just volatility due to seasonal reasons. but an interesting tidbit I want to share is that all of these companies blame the increase in prices on the pandemic claiming that it had a negative impact on the supply side. but as you can tell all companies have a growth in their inventories. All but Resolute Forest value their inventories using the lower of costs. meaning that discounting the growth in inventories should be done to a minimum. They also blame an increase of demand from people working at home for the increase in business. This makes sense. But when you include the fact that the price of wood has doubled since last year it's a little bit unreasonable to say that the massive increase in revenue is due strictly to demand side. More than likely they increased wood prices is to make up for any lack in profits they would have gotten and now they don't want to lower them because they see how much more money they're making. 

Everything I shared with you is because a friend at work noticed this with west fraser. I wanted to confirm that this was a market wide phenomenon. I think it is safe to say that the increase in wood isnt market force related but rather artificially inflated reasons. Let me know what you think in the comments. This is my first time ever sharing research I did and If I missed a crucial step I would love the critique. If I get good at doing this I will probably submit more findings I have in the future.

However, I would recommend to everyone to at least acknowledge that a short squeeze is potentially happening, and could potentially continue to happen. What this means is you should be weary of which Hedge Funds are shorting AMC at the moment, AND WHAT THEIR LONG POSITIONS ARE.

If a year from now the S&P is down 20% from where we are today we can justify it. If it is up 20% we can justify it. Doesn't mean we know anything today.

Submission,nbmq5e,Just sold everything and went index fund...,alexshim,"I just sold all my tech/meme stocks and just went straight to index funds. Over the past few months of ""investing"" I realized volatility is not my friend. Maybe that is the wrong approach but I figured, I'll take the loss as a tax credit and just keep everything in VTI/SCHG and some dividend stocks.

Edit: thanks for the support

An example I’ll use is PLTR.
On March 8th it was at 22$. Analysts were saying buy buy buy. Great. So as of today, it is down 20% from March 8th. Vs VTI, March 8th it was 200, closed at 211 today so you’d be up 6%. Of course, you can wait 5 more years, and maybe PLTR will get to 40-45 again... that is if they don’t have competition, no issues with their business model... whole VTI may go up 30-35% but with less stress of worrying about an individual company... yes less risk, less reward...

Edit:
There have been some messages about ""paper hands"" etc, buy high sell low... valid points perhaps, but, 
I did this for my own self, as I realized that:
 1. I am not a person who can handle the volatility of some of these stocks, I am sure that they will go up in 1,2,3, years etc, but if they do, so will VTI / VOO / SPY.... maybe not to the same level but the road will be less bumpy
 2. This is a way to build a base of my portfolio. I will go back to stocks, but to at a much lower exposure. I do think that inflation will be an issue over the next few years and I think some of the tech stocks will be up / down for the next bit. Especially those companies that are trading at 100x their earnings, so I am sure I will have the opportunity to re-enter (again my opinion). 

In the meantime, I sold, yes I took a loss, but this will be used against any gains I did make this year my offset my taxes a bit (not sure how much, will see in Jan).",Trades,,1360,t3_nbmq5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nbmq5e/just_sold_everything_and_went_index_fund/,3854,0.86,[1620928322.0]

# The Income Statement

**What is it?**

The income statement is one of the most common and important financial  statements you’ll come across. It’s also known as the profit and loss  (P&L) statement, summarizing all income and expenses over the period  of analysis, often shared as quarterly and annual reports.

**What is its purpose?**

The function of an income statement is to show a company’s financial performance over the period of analysis.

**What is inside an income statement?**

* **Revenue:** The amount of money a business takes in during a reporting period
* **Expenses:** The amount of money a business spends during a reporting period
* **Costs of goods sold (COGS):** The cost of component parts of what it takes to make whatever it is a business sells
* **Gross profit:** Total revenue less COGS
* **Operating income:** Gross profit less operating expenses
* **Income before taxes:** Operating income less non-operating expenses
* **Net income:** Income before taxes less taxes
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** Division of net income by the total number of outstanding shares
* **Depreciation:** The extent to which assets (for example, aging equipment) have lost value over time
* **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization

>*These items often contain sub categories and separate line items depending on a company’s reporting and accounting policies.*

**Classifying Expenses**

**There are three different types of expenses**

**1.** **Operating Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associate with the operations of the business.**b.** Direct costs of producing the product/service and other expenses associated with production, including SG&A expenses.

**2.** **Financing Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associated with the use on non-equity financing.**b.** Most often taking form of interest expenses on debt.

**3.** **Capital Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses that provide benefits over many years.**b.** For a manufacturing company these can be plant & equipment.**c.** For non-manufacturing companies they can be less conventional and tangible forms.

**Their Placement**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/WCDqBee*](https://imgur.com/WCDqBee)  
>  
>📌 **SUMMARY:**  Operating expenses associate with operations of the business, financing  expenses with non-equity financing and capital expenses with ones that  provide benefit over many years.

# Revenue Recognition

For  most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a  product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues. For firms that  sell products or services over many years (eg. subscriptions) it becomes  trickier.

**Under ASC 606 (new revenue recognition standard):**

* The  new model’s core principle for revenue recognition is to “depict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.”
* Thus,  for a real estate developer working on a multi-year construction,  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses, and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years, performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized.

>**📌  SUMMARY: For most firms, when a product or service is sold, it is  recorded as revenues. For firms that deal with long term contracts,  memberships, subscriptions etc. revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration - eg. $120,000 for 1 year of service = $10,000/month recorded  revenue.**

# Revenue breakdowns

As companies enter **multiple businesses and different geographies**, it is useful to know **where they generate their revenues.**

**Where** are **geographic breakdowns found?**

* While the breakdown can **sometimes** by provided in **income statements**, they are more likely to be part of the **footnotes to the financial statements.**
* Companies generally break down ***revenues by geography***, though the degree of detail can vary.
* Companies also break down ***revenues by business segment***, though there is an element of **subjectivity to the segment categorization.**

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies generally **break down revenues by geography** with a varying degree of detail and **revenues by business segments**  subjective to the segment categorization. Both can sometimes be found  in the income statement, but generally they are found in the **footnotes of the financial statements.**

# Operating expenses: Breakdown

Operating  expenses are broken down into expenses directly related to producing  the goods or services that give rise to revenues, i.e. cost of goods  sold, and expenses that are related to operations, but which are not as  directly tied to revenues.

**How** are operating expense broken down?

1. Expenses directly **related to the production** of goods / services that **increase revenues.** These are **netted out** form **revenues to get gross profits.**
2. Expenses related to operations, not directly tied to revenues. These are **netted out** from **gross profits to get operating income.**

**SG&A Costs**

1. In many companies, the **largest** **non-operating expense is S, G & A**, a term that can include everything but the kitchen sink.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Companies **break down revenues** by how they **relate to production** or **operations.** The **former tied to the increase of revenues,** the **latter not.**

# Depreciation

There are three forms of depreciation; **economic, accounting & tax depreciation.**

1. **Economic Depreciation**

This reflects the **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** It requires nuance, and will vary across even the same type of assets, depending on how it is used.

2. **Accounting Depreciation**

This is more mechanical and is **driven largely by the aging of the asset**, with the differences often being in whether it happens **uniformly over the life of the asset or is more accelerated.**

3. **Tax Depreciation**

This reflects what the tax authorities will allow as **depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Economic** depreciation reflects **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** **Accounting** depreciation is **driven by the aging of an asset,** **depending** if it occurs **over the life time of the asset or in a more accelerated period.** **Tax** depreciation reflects **what authorities allow as depreciation** for purposes of **computing taxable income.**

# Financial expenses

The most common financial expense is **interest expense on debt**, either in the form of bank loans or corporate bonds.

**Some interest expense is implicit**

As accountants classify other **commitments (such as leases) as debt, some of the interest expense is implicit**, i.e., it is calculated by accountants **based upon their assessment** of the **debt equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.**

**If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

In some companies, **interest expenses are netted out against interest income earned by the company on its cash holdings** and **financial investments**, and **reported as a net interest expense**. If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.

>**📌 SUMMARY:** Most **common financial expense is interest expense on debt**, either **bank loans or corporate bonds.** Accountants classify **other commitments (leases etc.) as debt,** making some **interest  expense implicit and calculated based on their assessment of debt  equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.** Some companies net out interest expense against interest income earned on cash holdings and financial investments. If **interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

# Income from non-operating investments

Income  earned from cash & marketable securities are reported different  then income earned from cross holdings in other companies.

**Cash & Marketable Securities**

**Income earned on cash holdings** (which is invested in marketable securities, like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies) will be **reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses.**

**Cross holdings** in other companies

* Reporting can vary upon the magnitude of your holding:
* When you hold a (**small or minority**) portion of **another company,** the **income** from that holding will **usually be reported in the income statement.**
* If you hold a **majority stake of another company**, you will generally **have to consolidate your financials.** You will **count 100% of the subsidiary’s revenues,** **operating expenses and operating income as your own.**

>**📌 SUMMARY: Income earned** on **cash holdings** will be reported either as a s**tand alone income or netted against interest expenses. Income** earned from **minority stake** in a company will usually be reported in the **income statement.** If you hold a **majority  stake of another company, you will consolidate 100% of it's revenues,  operating expenses and operation income as your own.**

# Extraordinary Income/Expenses

As the term implies, extraordinary income and expenses are designed to capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations.**

**Extraordinary** items include:

* **One-time expense or gain** from **sale of assets or divisions**
* **Write offs or charges** associated with **past project, lawsuits or fines**
* **Impairment of goodwill from acquisitions** in the **past**

**Truly extraordinary** items:

* If an item is **truly extraordinary**, it should show up **infrequently** and the amount associated with it **should vary**.

>**📌 SUMMARY: Extraordinary** items and expenses capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations**. If an item shows up **regularly and consistently, it is not extraordinary.**

# Income Statement Analysis

There are **two** **methods** to read and analyze financial documents: **vertical and horizontal analysis.**

**Vertical Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/tsbdF73*](https://imgur.com/tsbdF73)

This  method of analysis, as the name suggests, is top – down. You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentage.

This type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries, and between companies, because you can  see relative  proportions. It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improving.

Vertical analysis isn’t  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis, but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked,  such as: *Where did costs rise or fall? What line items are contributing most to profit margins? How are they affected over time?*

**E.g** – here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by side

**Horizontal Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y*](https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y)

This method of analysis focuses on **year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) performance.**

Horizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It improves the review  of a  company’s consistency over time, as well as its growth compared to   competitors.

Because of this,  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts. By  conducting a horizontal analysis, you can tell what’s been  driving an  organization’s financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns, line item by line item. Ultimately,  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over time—comparisons  from Q1 to  Q2, for example—instead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to others.

**To perform horizontal analysis you:**

1. Take the value of Period N
2. Divide it by the value of Period N-1
3. Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage change

>**E.g –** ***Revenue in 2017 was $4,000 and in 2016 it was $3,000. The YoY change in revenue is $4000/$3000 – 1 = 33%.***",Resources,,125,t3_nlhcci,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nlhcci/accounting_101_part_1_the_income_statement/,3336,0.97,[1622036532.0]

Submission,nlhpv3,Dutch court rules oil giant Shell must cut carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 in landmark case,TaxShield," LONDON — A Dutch court on Wednesday ruled oil giant [Royal Dutch Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDS.A) must reduce its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels.

That’s a much higher reduction than the company’s current aim of lowering its emissions by 20% by 2030.

Shell’s current [climate strategy](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/our-climate-target/_jcr_content/par/relatedtopics.stream/1621314462494/d53de79d4e951642456e928cdfd18b0a1867cf4d/our-climate-target.pdf) states that the company is aiming to become a net-zero emissions business by 2050, with the company setting a target of cutting its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2035.

CNBC contacted Shell to request a comment on the ruling.

Shares of Shell were trading 0.3% lower in London. The stock price is up almost 10% year-to-date, having tumbled nearly 40% in 2020.

The lawsuit was filed in April 2019 by seven activist groups — including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace — on behalf of 17,200 Dutch citizens. Court summons claimed [Shell](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RDSA-GB)’s business model “is endangering human rights and lives” by posing a threat to the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement.

Under the Paris Agreement — a landmark deal adopted in 2015 and signed by 195 countries — nations agreed to a framework to prevent global temperatures from rising by any more than 2 degrees Celsius, although the accord aims to prevent global temperature rises exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius.

At Shell’s annual general meeting last week, shareholders [voted overwhelmingly in favor](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/shell-secures-backing-for-climate-strategy-but-growing-minority-rebel.html) of the company’s energy transition plans — but, crucially, a growing minority rejected the strategy, insisting the oil giant needed to do much more in the fight against climate change.

Activist investor Follow This said at the time that the result was likely to mean Shell would have to revise its climate targets once again.

According to Reuters, the case is the first in which activists have taken a major energy firm to court to compel it to overhaul its climate strategy.

When the lawsuit was filed, a lawyer acting on behalf of environmental groups said the case would “raise the pressure” on other fossil fuel companies.

Submission,ncfwmz,"Amazon To Hire 75K Fulfillment Workers With Starting Hourly Pay Of $17, Bonuses Up To $1K",Karnes,"'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) will employ 75,000 logistics and fulfillment workers in North America at an average starting wage of $17 an hour.

Most of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and network of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile delivery network at the closest range of the end customers.

Amazon has 409 delivery stations in the U.S., out of which 344 support package deliveries and the rest support heavy, bulky items that are typically non-conveyable.

Amazon plans to build 229 additional delivery stations, out of which 193 are meant for packages. Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.

Amazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.

In April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.

Last year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.

Amazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago. The company has refuted the allegations and assured necessary efforts for improved working conditions.'

Submission,nsu9pz,G7 nations back deal to tax multinationals,TODO_getLife,">The G7 group of advanced economies has reached a ""historic"" deal on taxing multi-national companies, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak says. Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to commit to the principle of a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 

>The deal - from the US, UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan - will put pressure on other countries to follow suit, including at a meeting of the G20 next month.

>At the moment companies can set up local branches in countries that have relatively low corporate tax rates and declare profits there.

>That means they only pay the local rate of tax, even if the profits mainly come from sales made elsewhere. This is legal and commonly done.

>The deal aims to stop this from happening in two ways.

>Firstly, the G7 want a global minimum tax rate so as to avoid a ""race to the bottom"" where countries can undercut each other with low tax rates.

# Overview of whats in it

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/WZNIuBY**](https://imgur.com/WZNIuBY)

# Assets

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/3UVsD43**](https://imgur.com/3UVsD43)  
>  
>An **asset** is defined as anything owned by a company that holds inherent, quantifiable value.

**Current assets** include anything a company expects it will convert into cash within a year, such as:

* Cash and cash equivalents
* Prepaid expenses
* Inventory
* Marketable securities
* Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent assets** include long-term investments that aren’t expected to be converted into cash in the short term, such as:

* Land
* Patents
* Trademarks
* Brands
* Goodwill
* Intellectual property
* Equipment used to produce goods or perform services

A **liability** is the opposite of an asset, it's something a company ***owes***.

**Current liabilities** refer to any liability due to the debtor within one year, which may include:

* Payroll expenses
* Rent payments
* Utility payments
* Debt financing
* Accounts payable
* Other accrued expenses

**Noncurrent liabilities** refer to any long-term obligations or debts which will not be due within one year, which might include:

* Leases
* Loans
* Bonds payable
* Provisions for pensions
* Deferred tax liabilities

Liabilities may also include an obligation to provide goods or services in the future.

# Shareholders Equity

**Shareholders' equity** refers to anything that belongs to the owners of a business after any liabilities are accounted for.

* Common stock
* Preferred stock
* Treasury stock
* Retained earnings

If  you were to add up all of the resources a business owns (the  assets)  and subtract all of the claims from third parties (the  liabilities),  the residual leftover is the owners’ equity.

# Dueling Views:

**Record of capital invested:**  There are some who believe that the main function of a balance sheet is  to record how much a business has invested in its assets-in-place,  i.e., the assets that allow for its current operations to occur.

**Measure of current value:**  There is a large and perhaps dominant school of thought among  accountants, or at least accounting rule writers, that a balance sheet  should reflect the value of the business today.

**Liquidation value:**  There is a third school, with lenders to the firm among its primary  members, who feel that a balance should reflect what you would get for  the assets of the firm, if you liquidated them today.

# Fixed and Current Assets

**The Old Way:** Two or three decades ago, the way you were taught to value fixed and current assets was to show them at **original cost, net of accounting depreciation.**

**The New Way:** As accounting has increasingly adopted the **fair value standard**, there has been a move to mark assets to current market value.

**Divergent Effects:** The difference in values that you get for assets, using the two approaches, varies. It is:

* **Greater on older assets than on newer ones**
* **Greater on fixed assets than current assets**

# Financial Assets

* Financial assets can be holdings of securities or part ownership of other companies, private or public.
* With  holdings of publicly traded securities, the movement to using current  market prices to mark up their values is almost complete.
* With equity ownership in other companies, the rules can vary depending on:
   * Whether  the stake is viewed as a majority stake (>50%) or a minority stake.  The former will lead to full consolidation (where 100% of the  subsidiaries revenues and operating income will be included in the  parent company’s financials, with the portion that is not owned shown as  minority or non-controlling interest on the liability side) and with  the latter, the actual stake will be shown as an asset.
   * With  a minority stake, whether it is held for trading or as a long-term  investment. With the former, the holding will be marked to market. With  the latter, it will be shown at book value terms.

# Intangible Assets

**Big game:**  Accountants talk a big game when it comes to intangible assets, and  from that talk, you would think that they have figured out how to value  the big intangibles (brand name, management quality etc.).

**But different reality:**  In reality, accountants are much better at valuing small-bore  intangibles like licenses and customer lists, where the earnings and  cash flows from the intangible are observable and forecastable than they  are at valuing the big intangibles.

# Goodwill

* After  all the talk of intangibles in accounting, it is telling that the bulk  of intangible assets on accounting balance sheets across the world take  the form of one item: **goodwill.**
* Goodwill is a plug variable that signifies little.
   * For goodwill to manifest itself on a balance sheet, a company has to do an **acquisition**.
   * When that **acquisition occurs**, goodwill is measured as the **difference between the price paid on the acquisition and the target company’s asset value (dressed up book value).**
   * It shows up as an asset because **without it in place, balance sheets would not balance.**

# Goodwill Impairment:

**Old rules:**  For much of the last century, goodwill once created in an acquisition,  was written off on autopilot, often amortized over long periods in equal  installments.

**New Rules:** In the late 1990s, both **GAAP** and **IFRS**  rewrote the rules, requiring accountants to revisit goodwill estimates  each year, and make judgments on whether the goodwill had been impaired  or not. To make that judgment, accountants would have to revisit the  target company valuations and decide whether the value had increased (in  which case goodwill would be left unchanged) or decreased (and goodwill  would be impaired).

**Is it informational?**  The rationale for this rule change was to provide information to  markets, but since goodwill impairments are often based upon market  pricing movements (in the sector) and lag them by months and sometimes  years, the effect of goodwill impairments on stock prices has been  negligible.

# Current Liabilities

**Current liabilities can be broadly broken into three groups:**

* **Non-interest-bearing** liabilities, such as accounts payable and supplier credit, which represent part of normal operations.
* **Interest-bearing** short-term borrowings such as commercial paper, short term debt and the short term portion (<1 year) of long term debt.
* **Deferred** salaries, taxes and other amounts due in the short term.

When  computing non-cash working capital, we do not include interest-bearing  short term debt in the calculation, moving it instead into the debt  column.

# Debt Due

When companies borrow money, it can take three forms:

1. **Corporate bonds**, represent debt raised from public markets
2. **Bank loans**, debt raised from banks and other lending institutions
3. **Lease debt**,  arising out of lease contracts requiring lease payments in future  years. Until 2019, only leases classified as capital leases qualified,  but since 2019, operating lease commitments are also debt.

The **mark-to-market movement** on the **asset** side of the balance sheet has been muted on the **liability**  side of the balance sheet. Bank debt, for the most part, is recorded as  originally borrowed, and corporate bonds due, are for the most part not  marked to market.

# Debt details

While  balance sheets are the repositories for total debt due, broken down  into current and long term, there is additional information on debt in  the footnotes, for most companies.

**This additional information can be on three fronts:**

1. Individual debt due, with stated interest rates and maturities.
2. Additional features on the debt, including floating/fixed and straight/convertible provisions.
3. A consolidated table of when debt repayments come due, by year.

# Shareholder’s Equity

**Old ways:**  The shareholders’ equity in a business was a reflection of its entire  history, since it started with the equity brought in to start the  business, adds on equity augmentations over time as well as the  cumulation of retained earnings.

**New ways:** The shareholders’ equity in a business reflects the jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting, with all of its contradictions.",Resources,,73,t3_nm4kla,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nm4kla/accounting_101_part_2_the_balance_sheet/,1495,0.97,[1622111934.0]

Tomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.

The government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.

Now let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.

You remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.

The SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.

So, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.

You've already figured it out. The burger company is what we call a value stock. The SkyNet company is the growth stock. And since everyone expects inflation, we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks.",Resources,,245,t3_nazu9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nazu9q/inflation_explained_like_youre_five/,1332,0.95,[1620854657.0]
Submission,nskazq,Wall Street Reins In Hedge Funds’ Short Bets on Meme Stocks,nams0,"> (Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular meme stocks.

> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., M***oV****n Inc. and GameStop Corp.

> The changes mean some hedge funds and other institutional investors now face higher collateral requirements or are limited from shorting certain stocks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy decisions.

> “Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options” in GameStop, AMC and M***oV****n, the firm said in a memo to clients seen by Bloomberg News. Naked options allow investors to short a stock without owning the underlying securities. Jefferies, which told clients that other stocks may be added to the list, will also no longer permit short sales of those securities.

> Representatives of Goldman, Bank of America,Citigroup and Jefferies declined to comment. It’s not unusual for banks to adjust their risk controls as market conditions change.

> The measures may change the fortunes of retail investors lighting up Reddit message boards with their forays into day trading. Increased margin requirements could hasten the short squeezes small investors have been rushing to capitalize on. On the other hand, if hedge funds pull back on short bets due to the new restrictions, the Reddit crowd won’t have as many opportunities to chase short squeezes.

I'm 27, I've had money tied up in a house for the past several years, and have idly sat on the sidelines as certain stocks I flirted with in 2016 went up exponentially (AMD, I see u).

I am a layman when it comes to Stocks, and ETFs, and Calls/Puts etc. I opened a Schwab account a couple of weeks back and bought 20K of APPL @ around 127.00 (I was scared it would jump, if I sat around waiting for a targeted stock price). I posted here prior to making that move, and was generally pointed towards ETFs like VTI, VT, and the like. But Idk, APPL's trendy and seems, almost criminally, underrated. I plan to @ least hold this investment for 5 years, maybe longer.

Part of me did want to go the tranquil route of ETFs and Mutual Funds, but I do not know. Chalk up to being a desperate millennial looking for a safe alternative to Meme Stocks/Crypto, or long term speculation. Regardless, I sit comfortably positioned and as confident on APPL as I would on any ETF.

Imagine the ""sell"" button doesn't exist for 5 years.",InitializedVariable,"If you want to swing trade, try to cash out on short squeezes, whatever, then fine: You do you. Otherwise, if you actually want to *invest*, then let me give you a trick to help you approach the market correctly...

**Imagine that the ""sell"" button is greyed out until a security is held for 5 years.**

* You'll be holding this for 5+ years, so the time and effort spent on research and DD is fully justified.
* You won't be ""missing out"" if you buy it tomorrow, or next week, or whenever you fully understand it and feel ready to commit.
* It's worth the commitment, so it's completely reasonable to increase your position gradually over time (DCA).
* Market dips are lame, but who cares? It's not the 5d chart, it's the 5y -- and it's a 5y chart that has yet to be drawn.

**There are only three situations in which the ""sell"" button becomes available.**

* During your research, you find something that makes you lose faith in the security (e.g., you discover something that makes you doubt the company's leadership during an earnings report).
* You discover a competing security that you wish you would have known about previously. In this case, *roll your investment over*.
* You absolutely, positively need the money for an emergency. You should have enough money on hand to be able to weather a storm, but there are some extraneous circumstances where you absolutely must liquidate investments. (If this happens more than once, it's a sign that you do not have a sufficient emergency fund.)

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
> The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
> Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
> Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
> Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
> “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
> But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
> Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
> He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
> # Fed Ahead
> The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
> That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
> “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
> But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
> Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
> But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
> “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”
*****
> The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
> # Retail earnings and housing
> Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.
*****
> Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
> “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
> Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
> Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
> “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”
*****
> Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
> Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
> “The S&P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
> “The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week,” Redler said Friday. “It doesn’t mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.”

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> Last week’s monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldn’t have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Biden’s first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.

> The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

> Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

> While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

> We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

> Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

> If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

> In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

> # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

> We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

> Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”

> We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

> # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

> The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

> # ""Inflation"" Trends

> You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

> On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

> These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

> Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

> While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

> # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

> In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

> The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
> The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
> Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
> A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
> “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
> The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
> “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”
*****
> There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
> But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
> “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
> The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
> In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
> # No correction yet
> As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
> Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
> “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
> Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
> Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.
*****
> The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
> The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.
*****
> “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
> He said earnings for the S&P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
> Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
> “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
> Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
> Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
> The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

> # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

> While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

> Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

> # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

> The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

> Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

> Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

> Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

> Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

> Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

> In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

> Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

> # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

> Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

> As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

> # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

> The S&P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

> Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

Submission,ndo7u3,What's causing ICLN to gradually decline since the January? Do you reckon it will recover?,its_all_pointless,"When I look at the graph of ICLN in the last 10 years, the there's been barely any growth in it until the pandemic hit and suddenly after April 2020, it started growing and kept growing until the beginning of January 2021.

Perhaps this sudden growth is down to the optimism that Biden will promote renewable energy, along with the US government's cash injection to boost the economy during the pandemic.

However, now that ICLN is back to its normal trend (4/2011 - 3/2020), do you reckon it will come back to north trending graph any time soon?

If they can maintain this pace, they would sell almost 60k EVs per quarter in Europe alone. Volkswagen estimates to sell 500k hybrids and 500k pure electric cars in 2021.

Volkswagen currently has a P/E ratio of 9.5, it is insanely cheap!

Submission,nq3ic1,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.

Last week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as “transitory” and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. 
* Construction spending rose only 0.2% in April over March, a sharp deceleration compared to March over February. Spending rose only 0.2% compared to 1% in March.
* “Meme stocks” continue their strong performance from last week, with AMC gapping up more than 20% again today. Crazy stuff!
* Coinbase (COIN) announced customers would be able to fund their account using Apple and Google wallets 
* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* Dollar General (DG) target raised by Deutsche Bank from $226 to $231 at Buy. Stock currently around $203
* Goldman Sachs (GS) target raised by Piper Sandler from $385 to $420 at Overweight. Stock currently around $372
* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $86 to $98 at Overweight. Stock currently around $84

Submission,nfj008,Things I wish people had told me when I started investing,TheSqueezeHasSquozen,"This is original content copied from my other post as this community doesn’t allow cross posts but is an equally good home for it.

I’ve been doing really well and I feel like sharing my thoughts for anyone interested. These are the things I wish I had known which would have saved me a lot of setbacks.

Ignore the charts. Don’t even look at them when making a decision. Regardless of what anyone says. A chart will only tell you what has happened so far. It will never tell you what will happen next. There is one exception to this I have found but I will bring that up at the very end of this post.

Use critical thinking for any single piece of information you read about a company or the market. Who published it and why? I haven’t yet found (and probably never will find) a single news article or post with neutral information on a company. And it’s never going to happen. In the stock market there are many different players and they all have different motives. Don’t trust what a Reddit investor tells you. But also don’t trust what CNN or CNBC tell you. There is something called “bias” and you have to be able to adjust the weight you give to any information you receive based on how biased the information is or might be. Any time you get information check multiple sources. Never rely on one single source. Or even one single type of source. If you only trust major news outlets you will be mislead or worse be behind the curve. If you only trust what investing forums say you are likely to run into people who are bagholding and trying to pump the stock to be able to dump it for a higher price before it keeps tanking. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Do your own research and don’t hesitate to use Google’s “past 24 hour” search filter to make sure you’re getting the latest information.

Stay open to criticism. If you have a good idea but someone knows better, it’s not just a learning experience but it can save you from losing your money. However, only take criticism seriously if someone can properly articulate their point and isn’t just spouting catchphrases or being an asshole.

Dollar cost averaging. It’s better to make several buys into a stock than one giant buy. It’s impossible to perfectly time the market. But you will almost always get a better entry point by averaging than by throwing down all the chips on the first move.

Always do your own due diligence. If you can’t write a thesis explaining why you’re making an investment (that’s not only convincing but free of confirmation bias) then you probably shouldn’t invest. Don’t just research the company, research the market the company is in. If the company is poised to do well and corner the market but there isn’t much of a market in general then there is no future for the company. In addition, research the “target audience” not for the company but for the shares themselves. What type of investors are buying shares? Are they the opportunistic kind? Are they buying just for a quick profit to scalp before they dump the stock into oblivion, or are they buying because they see a future for the company and plan a long term hold? This can be true of institutional investors as well as retail. It’s a better sign (for now anyway) when a happy whale like Cathie buys shares banking on the future of a company than if a super-predator like Chamath is buying them for a quick flip. Always keep other investors in mind when you make a decision. Investors are the consumer that drives the price of a share.

Buy the dip but only if you have a good reason to! Don’t blindly buy every dip. I see that pushed too often on Reddit. Buying a dip is good if a company is on an upwards trend and the dip occurred randomly. Do NOT buy the dip if it’s part of a larger downtrend or if it’s possibly due to an overall change in sentiment. Worst case scenario you will multiply your loss and best case scenario you will tie up further capital on a loser which results in decreased ammunition if you suddenly find a winner. Your $500 you could have used to buy a gainer will now be $300 you can use to buy another stock.

Don’t ever hesitate to cut your losses. If a company is in a downwards trend and it looks like they will be for a while (and there is no catalyst around the corner) cut the loss. Put your money in a better place. But keep watching the ticker. You can always buy back in when the sentiment turns positive. Keep a watchlist of stocks that look promising but don’t make it so big that you lose oversight and don’t make it so small that you’re missing too many opportunities.

Gauge your performance by your method and not by your gains and losses. If you’re up 100%, be honest with yourself. Are you up because you got lucky or because you have a solid strategy? If you’re down 40%, was it because of unpredictable factors or was it your own fault because you bought due to fear of missing out which clouded your thinking? Never beat yourself up. Learn from every move you make. Remember it’s impossible to perfectly time anything. If you sold and secured a 10% gain but it could have been 15%, that’s normal. You’re never going to catch the top of a spike or the bottom of a dip. That’s like waiting in the ocean for the perfect wave. It won’t happen and you’ll drown unless you’ve learned to surf when the wave gets to you. Same with buying. Most of the time when you buy, the stock will move down. I’ve lost a small percentage at the start of almost all my well planned and well timed moves. I kept holding and the losses turned into significant gains.

Manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, the lower percentage of your profile you should put into it. Be psychologically prepared to lose everything. The more you’re willing to live with that possibility, the more you’re going to be able to keep a cool mind when taking a calculated risk.

Never stop learning. The more you know, the more of an edge you have. Get in the habit of reading several articles per day. Focus on your existing investments so you can learn how what type of news affects the markets in which ways.

Never stop looking for opportunities. They don’t come to you. You have to find them like a needle in a haystack or a diamond in the rough. You’ll get much better at finding them with time. If you don’t get good at looking for opportunities and evaluating them then you won’t have any opportunities.

Never buy in to hype. The more hyped a stock is, the more likely it is that it will tank later. Even if you find a promising company for a good long term investment, wait until the hype dies down and the share price goes down. Otherwise you’ll start your investment with a slow and steady loss.

Shares are priced based on supply and demand. There are bids and there are asks. The higher the demand is on shares the higher the bids will be. The lower the demand is on a share the lower the bids will be. What this means is that when there is more buying pressure than selling pressure the cost of a share goes up. When there is more selling pressure than buying pressure the cost of a share goes down. In fact, that is all a chart will really tell you. Think of a chart as a historical look at past buying and selling pressure. Nothing more and nothing less. The price direction is determined only by buying and selling pressure.

The value of a share is subjective. You can run any equation you want to but there is no equation which links any of the variables of a company to the price of a share. There are many different ways to “value” stocks. DDM, DCF, price to earnings, price to book, enterprise value to EBIDTA, Technicals...and they all mean nothing. Why? Because the value of a share is what people are willing to pay for it. A stock is no different than a consumer good. Take, for example, iPhone. If you compare the iPhone 12 to android phones with similar specs the iPhone 12 price tag more than doubles some lesser known brands with the same specs. But people are willing to pay more for the iPhone. So the iPhone costs more. The value of a share is the same. If people are willing to pay more for a share of a company then those shares will cost more even if there is no mathematically verifiable reason.

There is no formula based on the specs of a phone which will predict what the retail cost of the device will be. Just like there is no formula which will take any company metrics into account and determine the price of a share.

Stocks go up and stocks go down. Everyone hates red days. But they’re normal and they’re not a sign you’re doing something wrong. They mostly move when there are catalysts that have either positive or negative effects on sentiment. The rest of the time they will trade sideways or slightly downwards. As long as the slope isn’t steep and there have been no bad news about the company having a red day is fine. In fact if a stock was only green all the time I would probably sell it because that could be a good sign it’s in a bubble and bubbles are known for bursting.

The biggest gains and losses in the market are driven by the biggest changes in investor sentiment. And investor sentiment isn’t rational. It’s irrational. For example there could be some slight bad news about a company which will have no bearing on the bottom line (for example a brief delay in a crucial step) which hits a nerve and causes an emotional overreaction which causes the stock to tank. Or there could be some neutral news about a company which investors mistakenly perceive as positive causing the stock to skyrocket.

Catalysts don’t matter. People’s reactions to the catalysts matter. If you look into a company that has upcoming catalysts, don’t focus on how the catalysts will effect the bottom line for the company. Focus on how the catalysts will impact investor sentiment. For example, if a company decides to increase the cost of a pharmaceutical product and they are now going to make 12 billion more dollars over the next 5 years, that’s great for the company. But if people are upset and there is bad publicity like “My mother died because she couldn’t afford her diabetes medication after the price hike.” then the value of a share will go down.

The biggest gains are in speculative investing but they also carry the highest risk. The reason that speculation has the biggest potential for gains is strictly due to human psychology. Investors are going to be a lot more fearful to invest in a company which isn’t generating revenue or where the future of a company has no proven results to back it up. Even if that company is going to cure cancer. But that’s also why there is the potential for a huge reward. If you can find a company investors are fearful to invest in now and you have enough data about the company to conclude that they are going to be successful, then you can actually turn a speculation into a somewhat more secure investment. 

For example, if a company announces that they found a cure for alzheimer’s. And you just happen to be a neuroscientist. If you understand the science and you instantly realize that they have a disruptive breakthrough, you can now use that to your advantage. You can invest in the company now with the knowledge that the science is solid. This gives you an edge. You know that you know the company will be a success. But you also know that anyone who isn’t a neuroscientist will have little faith in the company. As a result, you have now found a company which is setup for a massive change in sentiment. So you buy 10,000 shares for $0.03. Eventually, the company moves through to phase 3 clinical trials and the product gets approved. The news headlines hit that a company cured alzheimers. Now the shares you bought for $0.03 are suddenly worth $15. Your degree in neuroscience just paid off better than your actual day job as a neuroscientist. As the stock keeps trending upwards the $300 you spent is now $150,000. This gain is mostly attributable to using your existing knowledge to get ahead of a pivot in investor sentiment.

Use what you know. Just like the example above. Everyone has areas they are more or less knowledgeable about. If you know a lot about technology, focus on technology stocks. If you are a geologist, focus on mining stocks. Anyone can have an advantage. Even if you’re working at a deadbeat job and you get a free sample for an air freshener that finally actually gets rid of the smell of stale cigarettes in your well used car, invest in that air freshener. Any single piece of knowledge you have about any single thing can be used to your advantage to make a trade.

Which company evaluations actually do matter? Is the company going to be able to survive? That’s the main thing I’ve been looking at with my speculations. A company could have come out with a technological breakthrough. But do they have the funding or an existing revenue stream to carry it out? Are they going to be consumed by debt and implode or are they getting funding in one way or another? Another important one is if another company will buy them out. If a company has mediocre performance and is going to be bought out by Microsoft that can be great for your investment. But if a company has a breakthrough, doesn’t have the resources to commercialize it themselves and has to give in to the highest bidder for a buyout then the upside to your investment is going to be a lot more limited.

Those are really the only company metrics I’m focused on.

Stay up to date on your investments. Don’t just look at your portfolio once a month and complain about it going up or down. Is your chart going up? Find out why. Is your chart going down? Find out why.

Stay ahead of the news! If it’s 5am and you have to get up for work, get in the habit of quickly checking the news on your tickers so that you can stay on top of any changes. The sooner you know bad news came out the more likely it is you will be able to hit the sell button before anyone else does. If you have tickers you’re watching, try to buy in the moment there is good news or in advance of the good news. Especially if the sentiment is positive.

Be careful with stop losses. If you don’t know what a stop loss is, it basically means that you have set up your purchase so that your broker will sell your shares for you if they dip below a certain amount. They can be great for risk management but they can also screw you over. If you bought a company for $10 and you have a stop loss at $8 you won’t be happy when it dips to $7.50 before shooting up to $20. Because now your stop loss actually worked against you. You lost a +100% gain and you secured a loss. Another time stop losses can be unhelpful is if your stock is trading on a foreign exchange as well. For example, if you have a stock on the NASDAQ trading for $10 and a stop loss for $9 but it also trades on a European exchange. It the stock closes at $10 but tanks overnight and trading opens at $5 on the NASDAQ, your stop loss will have done nothing. Even worse, it’s possible your stop loss won’t be triggered at all now because the system won’t pull the trigger while the price of the shares continues to drop.

Market buys, market sells, limit buys and limit sells. I see a lot of confusion about this online and quite a few people get limit orders mixed up with the bid-ask spread. Small fish investors like retail have nothing to do with the bid-ask spread. When you place a market buy order through your broker you are agreeing to purchase a set number of shares at the current market price. I never use market orders. Why? Because if you execute a market buy or a market sell and the price of the security changes rapidly it won’t fill at all. And in order to cancel it and place a new order you first have to find it, then cancel it and then place a new order. I always use limit orders. If I’m buying shares and the cost looks like it’s on an upwards trend I will always place a limit buy for a price quite a bit higher than the current market value. Some people seem to think you won’t get the best price possible that way but this is wrong. If a stock is trading for $8 and you put in a limit buy for $8.50 but the stock only goes up to $8.10 your broker will fill it at $8.10. If I’m buying shares and the cost of the security looks like it’s currently on a downwards trend I will place a limit buy just a bit above what I think it will drop down to. That way I don’t have to stare at the chart all day and I can check throughout the day and place a new order if the direction changed and it didn’t fall below that point yet. As far as selling goes I will always place limit orders as well to guarantee the trade goes through instead of putting faith in a lack of volatility and risking the sell not going through. If the stock is going down I will place a limit sell for a lower price. If the stock is going up I will place a limit sell for a higher price. I won’t make them too much higher or too much lower though because this is the opposite of buying and I don’t want the stock to get stuck to my hands when I’m trying to dump it.

Since investor sentiment drives the price of shares, wouldn’t it be nice if there was a single quick way to gauge the current investor sentiment towards a company? As it turns out, you can! And you can do it really quickly by eyeballing a chart even if you don’t have a clue what you’re doing. Here’s how. Take a look at the chart. Focus on points in the chart where there have been sudden upwards and sudden downwards movements. And look at what happens following those movements.

If the stock dropped 12% due to some bad news, what happens next? Does it stay down or does it climb back up? The quicker it climbs back up out of a dip, the more positive investor sentiment is.

If the stock jumped up 12% due to some good news, what happens next? Does it stay up and slowly keep rising or does it tank back down to levels even lower than before the spike? The quicker it drops back down after a spike, the more negative investor sentiment is.

Keep in mind though that investor sentiment can change and just because there has been overall positive or negative sentiment in the past does not mean that the sentiment will continue. Check news for any updates on the company. Make sure nothing is in the works that could cause the sentiment to change to the negative when you are buying in. Check stock message boards. Check financial news. Use your brokers news feed, they are often quicker to the punch.

It’s definitely more profitable to buy something that has overall positive sentiment.

Edit: I will add, don’t ever be afraid to re-evaluate your strategy. If it isn’t working there’s a good chance it will keep not working. It’s better to try something new than to watch your portfolio slowly erode while you have plenty of time to research and make new moves.",Advice,,163,t3_nfj008,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nfj008/things_i_wish_people_had_told_me_when_i_started/,384,0.89,[1621364299.0]

Submission,narq4c,Lesson learned from buying “the dip”.,anthonyd3ca,"I began investing it the second half of 2020 and like most people, things were going very well until February hit. 

Everyone started saying “buy the dip” and “it’s on sale!” when a stock dropped 4-5% and it sounded like a good idea to make back a quick 5% once the stock recovered. However the dips kept coming and every 5-8% drop I kept “buying the dip”.

I now realized how 5-8% is barely a dip and I should’ve waited for at least a 10-15% drop in price before buying more. Now I’ve got little capital left to buy at these 30-50% drops from ATH and I just gotta weather the storm until (hopefully) these climb back up. Lesson learned.

Submission,n8lkh6,"The love/hate mating dance of Cathie Wood (ARK) with this subreddit, her take on this correction and her strategy going forward",TaxShield,"Preface: I'm **not** invested in any ARK funds myself. I do hold some of the stocks in her funds.

Loved by most of this subreddit in 2020. Hated by most in 2021. Yikes. In the past 3 months, correlating with the sharp drop in most of her funds (Most of them have dropped 30%+ since February), more and more people have started critizing ARK. ARK has seen outflows of more than $750 million in the last week. Now, everyone has a different take on whether her stock picks will do well or not, that's fine. I think we can all agree that 2020 has been an extraordinary year, with growth / tech / speculative stocks being the absolute winners of this mad year, mostly due to historically never before seen low interest rates, but also affected by a huge in-flow of new investors, support packages which are focused on certain sectors (Clean energy for example). More traditional sectors have underperformed last year, yet we've been seeing an institutional rotation away from speculative stocks into more value oriented names. 

However, let's not forget that pretty much all ARK funds are still up 300%+ up from the beginning of 2020. And while the sectors ARK is heavily invested in outperformed hard, they are most likely primed to underperform this year as institutions rotated away with interest rates picking back up and the global economy slowly opening again. Is this a problem though? No. 300% in a year is insanity. This is a healthy correction. And while it may hurt seeing your portfolio like this, this is a good moment to remember why you invested the way you did (and also a good moment for self-reflection). 

Whether the criticism she's getting lately is deserved, i'll leave that up for debate. Some of her picks are HIGHLY questionable in my opinion, yet i also see some as primed for explosive growth in the upcoming 5/10 years. She has also received a lot of criticism on here for selling her bigger blue chip stocks. Is this warranted? How does she view this correction?   


“I love this setup,” she said Friday on CNBC’. “The worst thing that could have happened to us is to have the market narrowly focus on just our ilk of stock — the innovation space. From our point of view — five-year time horizon — nothing has changed except the price,” she said. Back in February, Wood expected a 15% compound annual rate of return from her strategies, but after the recent fall in prices, she envisions that number rising to between 25% and 30%.""

In other words, she welcomes this. Now, obviously she would not say this is a disaster, as she is the fund manager. But there is also truth to her statement. Now, why does she love this setup? She sees this as an amazing buying opportunity, now that prices have dropped. But where does she get the money from? Mainly her blue chips, which is heavily debated on this sub.

 “The FAANGs certainly meet that criteria — they’re acting like defensives,” she said. “During a period of volatility like we’ve just seen, we will sell those stocks and move into either our more pure-play or earlier-stage innovation companies that are being hurt by risk-off.”  

I actually wrote a quite comprehensive piece on this (on this subreddit as well), diving deeper into her strategy, and how she exectutes this. To read more about this, click [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mtb0kc/analyzing_cathie_woods_ark_strategy_in_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

Let's not forget that most people (even fund managers) do not beat the market over a long term (and even less on a risk-adjusted basis). ARK funds have outperformed in 2020, and will most likely underperform in the short term. Whether it will underperform in the long term, who knows. Imo, she has some holdings that i do not see a future in, and her projections and valuations are... Rich to say the least. But let's not forget she was right with her earlier Tesla valuation when everyone called her crazy. It's also possible that this correction gives her the ability to make changes in her portfolio's for favorable prices, and thus makes higher returns possible. 

This is not financial advice. Do your own research.

My question is what is she supposed to do? Growth stocks as a whole have been taking a hit. The ARK Funds are described on their website as “ETFs focused on disruptive innovation”. This alone says ARK is bit of a risk and will focus on companies replacing the status quo. That may take some time. I do believe it will happen though. Take ARKF, for instance, she’s not going to go and invest in a company that prints out paper checks or manufactures atm cards. Square, Shopify, Zillow are a few of the top holdings. Obviously, each has seen incredible growth. They may taking a hit now but may represent the status quo in the future.

Also, other fintech etfs have suffered the same fate recently. Others may not have fallen so far but that seems to be because they weren’t as successful during the big run up late last year

Submission,nn1f5a,Be wary of stock discords,donemessedup123,"Hello everyone,

I am posting here since it was removed from [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/). I apologize to the mods if this is the right content for this sub.

With the popularity of stock trading at an all-time high, I just wanted to give a small PSA and a note about my experience joining stock trading groups on discord.

Long story short, I have searched around a few different discords to join a community I could learn more about stocks and trading. I can say without a doubt, that the vast majority of them have the following scheme attached to it:

1. Are pump and dumps where the admin, claiming to be an expert, will post a daily watchlist to encourage people to buy into stocks they already have a position in.
2. Are setup to convince people they need to subscribe to daily video and ""secret advice"" in order to make a quick buck.

Some of the people that run these discords are competent and I can see use manipulation tactics to come off as an authority on subject matters and encourage group think to forward the two objectives above. If you understand and learn the fundamentals of investing, you can tell they lack substance, but people green to investing can easily be enticed.

Be careful and research into communities you plan on joining. A few common red flags of toxic stock discords I have found include:

1. Stocks recommendations that constantly change on a daily basis.
2. Cult-like praise for public figures like Elon Musk.
3. Using words and tactics to encourage group-think (Such as ""stock fam"" and encouraging the posting of daily profits).
4. Due diligence that amounts to ""This company looks dope, they have a cool product,"" or ""Their product is the future"" without providing any knowledge of fundamentals, such as finance and balance sheet.

This may sound silly, but there are people out there who are looking to capitalize hard on this craze. Some will come off as smart and can be charismatic. If you haven't read into the fundamentals of finance and investing, their advice looks very enticing.

If you are looking for a community to join, be careful and always scrutinize people's suggestions.",,,56,t3_nn1f5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nn1f5a/be_wary_of_stock_discords/,256,0.95,[1622218745.0]
Submission,nkug7q,Investing more than you can afford,therealwaysexists,"...it happens.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night 

5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.

6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say ""assume it's money down the drain,"" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.

Submission,nnn1og,I think Xiaomi has huge long term potential in IoT - tech giant at a market cap of just $85 billion,jesperbj,"Xiaomi (HK: 1810) is a mere 11 years old and didn't go public until 2018 - the same year they turned profitable, yet the are a well known brand and already third in global smartphone sales.

A few days ago the company delivered a pretty wicked [earnings report](https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/05/26/xiaomi-posts-record-results-as-2021-q1-revenue-and-profit-hit-historical-high-levels/) with an adjusted net profit increase of 163%. 

 [Two days prior I published an article](https://jesbaek.com/2021/05/23/xiaomis-future/) of how their unique 'AIoT' and 'Internet Services' strategy will eventually allow the company to make much larger profits on revenue in the future.

Xiaomi commands one of the largest product portfolios with smart enabled devices of every category. In the West we don't yet see their smartphones too often - but their robo vacuum cleaners and electric scooters (They own Ninebot and Segway) and other smart home equipment is everywhere. They are basically taking the opposite route of Google and Apple in providing the hardware before the software - which also means they currently have higher costs and lower return on revenue.

Yet they are already profitable and sit on a cash pile of 5.6 billion. About 60% of their revenue right now is however attributed to their smartphones - which are doing extremely well. Their phones receive high praise (though their Android fork is not liked by all) and offer unbeatable performance for the price. They do well in every price category and own several well known sub brands like Redmi, Poco and Blackshark. As an example Mrwhosetheboss (huge tech YT channel) picked Xiaomi brands for all top 3 spots for his best phones of 2021 out of 22.

Xiaomi holds the top spot in market share in several emerging markets: India, Russia and most of Eastern Europe and soon South America. In Scandinavia where I live, they just recently entered local carrier stores, began advertising actively and opened a local [official webshop](http://www.mistore.dk). The ban on Huawei left a HUGE gap in the European market for Xiaomi to just freely gobble up and it seems like they are doing it. Xiaomi themselves have been [removed](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.androidauthority.com/xiaomi-us-remove-blacklist-1224721/) from a similar (but much less severe) blacklist by the US government this week as well. They do not pose the same threat as Huawei did, as they do not build infrastructure telecom equipment

There are rumors of the company designing their own SoCs (chips) in collaboration with OPPO and just last month they [invested $10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/chinas-xiaomi-to-launch-electric-car-business-and-invest-10-billion.html) into the Electric vehicle space. They already financially back Xpeng too and I think with the insane growth in the Chinese EV market they really have an opportunity to add even more value to their ecosystem integration.

The company is founded by Lei Jun and former Vice President of Google China and Zhou Gaungping then Senior Director at Motorola’s Beijing R&D Center. All three still lead the company today with Lei Jun as CEO. Xiaomi and their CEO has a huge following in China and a very dedicated loyal fan base. 

The company trades at a P/E of 23 and a share price of 28.6 HKD (~3.69 USD). The price to earnings is pretty typical for a tech stock but I think the benefits in profit of Xiaomi's strategy and investments are yet to be seen. I began buying up a few months ago and just doubled my investment after the earnings report. I will continue to buy in over atleast the next year and truly think this is a case of a company working hard for the future and with the right strategy. I saw the same patterns in Microsoft 6 years ago when Sadya Nedella took over and that position I'm up over 500%.

Please let me know what you think and if you feel like there is anything you feel like I need to address. I'm really bullish on this company and it helps balance my portfolio with exposure towards Asia. I know Chinese stocks can be effy and at least for me it was also quite the challenge to find a brokage where I could buy them.",Company Analysis,,104,t3_nnn1og,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nnn1og/i_think_xiaomi_has_huge_long_term_potential_in/,243,0.8,[1622293363.0]

Submission,nggtdd,"Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

“Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw new registrations fall 24% year-over-year in April in Germany, while Volkswagen AG's secured a 108.4% rise.

Tesla new registrations in Germany totaled 484 in April, while in the preceding month the tally was at 3,703 - a fall of 86.93%, according to data released by the country's federal motor transport authority, Das Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.

Comparatively, Volkswagen saw registrations totaled 43,230 in April 2021; in March the number was 56,550, indicating a month-over-month fall of 23.5%. The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”

Anyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”  

I am all in on VWAPY and POAHY. I am a bit biased - drive Porsche Macan and love it. Will be switching to Taycan within 12-18 months but apparently they are already back ordered for months.

EDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla. That’s three times as many as in 2019. Not too bad considering COVId.

It expects to sell about 8 million electrified vehicles globally by 2030, of which 2 million will be battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.*

*The company expects battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles will make up 15% of U.S. sales by 2030, and along with the company's hybrids and plug-in hybrids, 70% of the Toyota and Lexus combined sales mix will be electrified by 2030.*

*Earlier in 2021, Lexus unveiled the LF-Z, a conceptual look at the future of BEVs in the luxury segment. That was followed by the debut of the Toyota bZ4X concept, a battery electric SUV that will go into production in 2022.*

Two million EVs AND fuel cell vehicles in 2030 is an absolutely shockingly low number. Also, who do they think they will be selling these 6 million hybrid vehicles to? By 2030, EVs will be significantly cheaper than hybrid cars due to the expected battery cost decline of 60-80% this decade. Why would 75% of their customers pay more for a worse product?

Article for those who want a quick scroll. Companys that benefit from this are Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Air Products and Chemicals, and Air Liquide.

The Dutch government has granted a consortium that includes oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ExxonMobil (XOM.N) around 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in subsidies for what is set to become one of the largest carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in the world, the Port of Rotterdam said on Sunday.

Shell and Exxon requested the subsidies in January together with industrial gas suppliers Air Liquide and Air Products (APD.N) for a project which aims to capture CO2 emitted by factories and refineries in the Rotterdam port area and store it in empty Dutch gas fields in the North Sea. read more

The companies involved have been told that their applications will be granted, port spokesman Sjaak Poppe told Reuters, confirming an earlier report by Dutch public broadcaster NOS.

This clears the most important hurdle for the project, which is set to become operational in 2024 and is expected to reduce emissions in the industrial cluster surrounding Europe's largest sea port by around 10%.

Economy ministry spokesman Dion Huidekooper declined to comment on the reports on Sunday evening.

Details of the subsidies would be made public after decisions had been taken on all applications for this year, he said, which was expected to happen later this month.

The government has said it will grant a total of 5 billion euros in subsidies in 2021 for technologies that will help it achieve its climate goals.

It received applications for a total sum of 6.4 billion euros.

The CCS subsidies are meant to compensate the companies for the extra costs of capturing the greenhouse gasses instead of emitting them, while the port will provide the necessary infrastructure to transport the carbon dioxide to the empty offshore gas fields.

Home to many large industries and Europe's main seaport, the Netherlands is among the countries with the highest emissions of greenhouse gasses per capita in Europe.

It aims to lower emissions by 55% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. Emissions were down 24.5% from 1990 levels last year.


Now I'm not sure how big a benefit this will be, but I do know the likes of Air Products and Chemicals sell CO2. Excluding the subsidy, if they can capitalise on this, they may be able to use it as a steady source of revenue, but if this proves a successful method of reducing carbon, I feel like a lot of factories will jump to this over switching energy sources, as it would save them a lot of work.

Submission,niiukt,$BABA is Now A Value Stock with 50% Upside - Time to Load Up,Mr_JerryS,"First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

&#x200B;

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 3 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I loaded up shares at $212 after these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

&#x200B;

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that cause no harm to the environment, something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yes (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, just 10% off it's 52 week low.

&#x200B;

Now what REALLY caused me to go all in was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO.  For Munger to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Submission,nlufsp,"ViacomCBS surging as a potential buyout target, in the latest twist in the ""streaming wars""",CaptainCrypto,"VIAC stock jumped 3.81% today to $42.46 as rumours around a buyout continue to intensify, and I believe this is just the start. Several analysts agree with me, setting an average price target of $54 for the next 12 months.

I know it's been dismissed as a meme stock for the last wee while, due to the crazy rise and fall with the Archegos ‘incident’ and the hype around a possible pump after that implosion. But hear me out: I believe VIAC is actually a great value opportunity, with a solid 25-50% medium term upside.

There are a several reasons, which I’ll detail below, but essentially they have become a major buyout target as the streaming wars heat up between Netflix, Amazon, Disney and Apple. WarnerMedia (HBO) and Discovery just announced a huge merger, and Amazon has announced it would buy Hollywood studio MGM for just under $9 billion. That’s moving attention and speculation onto VIAC.

First, let’s analyse the quality of the business. ViacomCBS is a traditional broadcaster with a huge content library, that is currently pivoting from that dying business model and transitioning into streaming for obvious reasons. It is one of the world’s biggest content creators with its streaming service Paramount+ (rebranded from CBS All Access) carrying a content catalogue of 30,000 episodes, 2500 movies and 1000 live sports events. They are also diversifying with a free ad-driven service named Pluto TV, and premium offering Showtime.

Did I mention they have rights to the Superbowl? Content is king in streaming, and they have a huge number of popular shows and movies for a range of ages. To name a couple, they have StarTrek, NCIS, 60 Minutes, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible, Top Gun, Hawaii 5-0, Teen Mom, The Late Late Show with James Cordon, Survivor, Key & Peele, Big Brother, The Amazing Race along with traditional offerings like CBS news.

One of their best attractions and a major competitive advantage in my view is their huge children’s content library through Nickelodeon, making them an attractive option for families. Titles include Spongebob Squarepants, PAW Patrol, Avatar: The Last Airdender, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Dora the Explorer, Blue’s Clues and much much more. The list is very long, and this in particular has been driving subscriber growth recently.

Despite all of this, the company is one of the cheapest current offerings in streaming, due to a bizarre collapse in their stock price which has nothing to do with them. They were bought by an aggressive hedge fund named Archegos Capital, which collapsed in March, tanking the share price from $100 to $37. It appears that hedge fund had artificially elevated the price to reach those astronomical levels, but I believe at $42 it’s still below its intrinsic value.

For example, the stock’s P/E ratio is around 9.5, compared to the wider film and TV industry’s average P/E of 29.8. Discovery’s P/E for example is 22, Netflix is insane at 60. At the very least I believe this represents an opportunity to get into the streaming market for a cheap entry point, as demand is expected to increase by 20% annually for the next decade.

They make a lot of money having recently beat earnings (and beating the 4 earnings before that), and continue to outperform, picking up an extra 6 million subscribers for Paramount+ over the last 3 months. That will intensify as they expand to new areas (they’re moving to Australia) and start to prioritise streaming more as, for example, the new Top Gun reboot will be on P+ two months after it hits theatres.

But most importantly, the extremely low share price and its huge content library makes it an attractive buyout proposition for bigger players with cash to burn like Amazon or Apple. There are way too many providers in streaming right now, some will sink and some will swim, and having a content library like ViacomCBS would be a major jewel in the crown.

Netflix in particular is vulnerable in my view, as traditional broadcasters are refusing to licence their content to them while they create their own streaming services, forcing them to pivot to creating more original content. That’s extremely expensive to make and they’re picking up massive amounts of debt while they do this.

Overall, ignore the pump and dump bullshit that’s been floating around on WSB for the last couple of months, I believe VIAC will only become more attractive as the streaming space consolidates. Every merger and buyout makes them more valuable, and I believe the consolidation will speed up as the big players need to move fast to avoid being left behind.

I have a small holding (40 shares, averaged at $41.50) and I’m hanging in for a 50% gain over the next 12-24 months. I'll continue to buy anytime it dips below $40.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 10th, 2021.

# **Inflation is the big challenge for markets and the Fed in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/07/inflation-is-the-big-challenge-for-markets-and-the-fed-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> After April’s disappointing jobs report, market focus will shift squarely to inflation in the week ahead.
*****
> The tug-of-war over tech stocks will also continue to be a dominant force in the stock market, after Friday’s bounce more than halved the week’s losses in the S&P technology sector.
*****
> The April employment report was extremely disappointing with just 266,000 jobs created, well below the 1 million expected. The Friday report cast doubt on the expectations of some investors that the Fed will move toward paring back its so-called quantitative easing bond purchases later this year.
*****
> The thinking is if the inflation data appears hot when the consumer price index is reported Wednesday, it could ignite the debate about whether the Fed will have to tighten policy sooner than it would like. For now, the market is viewing the April jobs data as a distorted one-off report.
*****
> “It’s all about the inflation numbers. It’s all about the transitory nature and to what extent we’ll see it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group “It’s more relevant to the CPI month-over-month changes. If the month-over-month gains are starting to pick up steam, and we’re seeing 0.3% to 0.4%, that’s not transitory and that’s a problem for the Fed.”
*****
> Economists expect April CPI to rise 0.2% over March, after a gain of 0.6% the month earlier. But on a year-over-year basis, CPI is expected to look sizzling, jumping 3.6%, according to Dow Jones. That compares to 2.6% the month earlier. Excluding food and fuel, CPI is expected to rise by 0.3% on a month-over-month basis.
*****
> The central bank has maintained that the pop in inflation is expected to be transitory.
*****
> Multiple Fed speakers are on the calendar, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks a half-hour after the CPI print Wednesday. Other officials speaking include Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard, New York President John Williams and Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan.
*****
> The producer price index is reported Thursday, and that should confirm a trend of higher prices that is showing up in corporate earnings releases. Another important data point, retail sales is released Friday.
*****
> Boockvar said the retail sales report is not as important since it has been artificially boosted by one-time stimulus checks.
*****
> “It’s like the steroid era of baseball,” he said. “Who knows how many home runs it would have hit without stimulus.”
*****
> # Tech battleground
> The S&P 500 and Dow finished the past week with gains. The S&P rose 1.2% to 4,232, and 2.7% to 34,777. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell about 1.5% to 13,752, even with Friday’s 0.9% gain.
*****
> In the commodities market, fears of inflation continued to build.
*****
> Copper futures hit a record high, as did lumber futures, rising 13% in the past week. Corn futures rose 8.6% in the past week, finishing at the highest level since 2013.
*****
> West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 2% to $64.90 per barrel.
*****
> The 10-year note yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55%, down from 1.63% a week ago.
*****
> Commodities fueled gains in the stock market this week, with the S&P energy sector by far the best performer, up 8.9%. Materials rose 5.9%, followed by financials, which were up 4.2%. Industrials gained 3.4%. But the S&P technology sector slumped 0.5%, for the week even with a 0.8% gain Friday.
*****
> “I think one thing that people are overlooking is that the technology selling we’ve seen in the last few days...is not just the reaction to the adverse earnings price reactions that we saw from certain tech names,” said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG.
*****
> “But it’s also this idea in that in a world where we assume capital gains taxes could go up, that’s where the capital gains lie,” he added. “So they are likely to come under incrementally more pressure on that basis.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising capital gains taxes to 39.6% for taxpayers making more than $1 million. That’s up from the current top rate of 20%.
*****
> Emanuel said the upcoming federal income tax return filing date of May 17 could also be adding pressure to technology, since investors may be selling winners to pay their taxes.
*****
> “With the tax bill coming due on May 17 for the 2020 calendar year, people are just going to use it as an excuse within the context of higher capital gains taxes to sell those stocks to pay for their tax bill,” Emanuel said. “I think people are overlooking this as part of the reason.”
*****
> Boockvar said tech names could also face further headwinds from higher interest rates, particularly if inflation data is hotter than expected.
*****
> “I think the last couple of weeks tells you froth is coming out of the most expensive part of tech and earnings for the big cap names are as good as it gets in terms of growth rates. The market is telling you that,” he said. “If you get a further move in rates, that’s a headwind.”
*****
> Earnings season continues in the week ahead though most of the rush is over for the quarter. Disney, Marriott, Wynn Resorts, Airbnb are among the companies reporting that should provide insight on the economic reopening.

> # ARKK Stocks Breakdowns and Bounces

> After struggling for most of the past couple months, momentum and Tech stocks are broadly outperforming today as the Nasdaq is up 1.25% compared to a 0.78% gain in the S&P 500. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has been a poster child of the momentum theme over the past year. After a 383.9% gain from the March 2020 low to its high in mid-February, ARKK has fallen around 30% in the months since then. For most of that time, the ETF consolidated between its 50 and 200-DMA. After a failed attempt to break above its 50-DMA at the end of April, it has taken a leg lower, falling below its 200-DMA for the first time in a year in the process. While ARKK has yet to move back above its 200-DMA, it has found support around $105 which traces back to the lows earlier this spring and the highs from the fall. In other words, from a technical perspective ARKK, as well as some of its holdings, still have plenty of technical hurdles including moving back above its moving averages and breaking the past few months' downtrends. At least for the time being, the group has found some respite in the move higher today.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK.png))**

> As for the individual holdings of the ARKK ETF, below we show the 25 largest which accounts for approximately three-quarters of net asset value. For the most part, these stocks continue to sit on huge gains from the past year (or since their market debut for those that have IPO'ed in the past year; bolded and bordered rows in the table below) with only a small handful in the red: Teladoc (TDOC), Coinbase (COIN), and Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA). Even though the 25 largest ARKK holdings are on average up 117% over the past year, they have certainly been a pain trade recently. Most of these names are deeply oversold at the moment, and relative to their 52-week highs, they are down 35% on average. In fact, of all 58 holdings, there are only four—Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), TuSimple (TSP), Trimble (TRMB), and PACCAR (PCAR)—that are less than 10% below their 52-week highs, and none of these break into the top 25 largest holdings (as such they are not pictured below).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Table.png))**

> While ARKK holdings have generally been weak over the past few months, in recent days there have been some notable developments in the charts of these names. Some of these like CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and EXACT Sciences (EXAS) have fallen below the long-term 200-DMA. Other names in the ETF broke below their 200-DMA a while ago now, and their charts do not look much better. Stocks like Invitae (NVTA), Materialise (MTLS), and Teladoc (TDOC) collapsed below their long-term moving averages earlier this spring and this week's moves lower have resulted in breaks of critical support levels. For TDOC and MTLS, those levels have previously marked support at multiple points in the past year. One other interesting name in terms of performance today is Regeneron (REGN). Unlike many other ARKK stocks, REGN has actually been trending higher since March, albeit that is in the context of a much longer-term downtrend than many other ARKK holdings. Regardless, that recent rally has resulted in the stock to run right up to its long-term downtrend. In another move that is out of sync with its peers, today it has reversed lower, failing to break out from that downtrend.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050721-ARKK-Below1.png))**

> While most names have pulled back sharply and continue to trend lower to sideways at best, that is not to say all ARKK stocks have entirely negative charts. Similar to the ETF's chart, there are several names that have found support in the past couple of days. For example, DocuSign (DOCU), Iovance Biotherapeutics (IOVA), Palantir (PLTR), and Spotify (SPOT) are all bouncing off critical support levels of the past year. For others like Fate Therapeutics (FATE), Iridium (IRDM), PagerDuty (PD), PACCAR (PCAR), and Synopsis (SNPS), those support levels have also coincided with their moving averages. PACCAR is also notable in that it is even breaking back above its 50-DMA today. Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is attempting to move back above its 200-DMA. Perhaps one of the most technically strong stocks of these has been Sea Ltd (SEE). Over the past year, the 50-DMA has consistently provided reliable support. After a brief dip back below in March, in April it moved back above its 50-DMA and has once again successfully retested in the past week.

> In order to keep track of the ARK Innovation ETF's (ARKK) holdings, we created a custom portfolio that members can add here. Please note that this does not update real time and is only based on ARKK's holdings as of 5/6/21.

> As always, investors should do their own research before buying or selling any securities, and this chart analysis is in no way meant to be a buy or sell recommendation.

> # Commodities Soar to Five Year Highs

> As talk of inflation continues to heat up, one asset class fueling the fire has been the commodities complex. In our one-year review of the market low, we noted how commodities had been some of the biggest winners during the market recovery. Well that trend hasn’t stopped yet, and as shown in the chart below, on Wednesday, the Bloomberg Commodity Index closed at its highest level since August 2015.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Blog-5.7.21-a.png?ssl=1))**

> Whether this strength flows through to CPI or Core PCE (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation) remains to be seen, but the technicals suggest this move could just be getting started. WTI crude oil is on the verge of breaking above a level of technical resistance that capped prices in 2019, while copper prices are less than 3% from their 2011 all-time highs. However, those who thought gold would benefit from inflation fears have been mistaken. In fact, of the 23 commodities tracked in the Bloomberg Commodity Index, gold is the worst performing year to date and one of the few that is actually negative over that time period.

> To be clear, we are not calling for runaway inflation. In fact, breaking to five year highs shows that broadly commodities have gone nowhere over that time period. However, we do continue to have a bullish view of energy and industrial metals and wouldn’t be surprised to see this trend continue, albeit likely at a slower pace than the past year. If prices do continue to rise it may put more pressure on companies who are not able to pass those costs onto consumers. But if companies are broadly able to pass these increased input costs along, then expect price increases to begin showing up in traditional inflation measures, but any persistent impact is likely to be modest. Be sure to check out the LPL Research blog next Wednesday, as we examine the April CPI data release.

> # April Jobs Data Disappoints Lofty Expectations

> Investors betting on a continued acceleration in U.S. payrolls in April following March’s impressive numbers received an unwelcome reminder of just how choppy the data can be month-to-month.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added only 266,000 jobs in April, well below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 1,000,000. The prior two months also received net negative revisions of 78,000 jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.1% from 6%, though that was paired with an above-estimate gain in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.5% to 61.7%, equaling a recovery high. Average hourly earnings rose 0.7% month over month, signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected.

> Anecdotal commentary provided by companies in recent months detailing their difficulty finding qualified job candidates evidently worked its way into the data this month in a big way. There are a few explanations for why this might be. Enhanced unemployment benefits may reduce the urgency for some to return to work. Additionally, still-closed schools and lack of child-care may make it difficult for workers to return to the in-person segments of the labor markets. And finally, March’s big jump in payrolls may have represented a rehiring of workers with whom hiring managers already had relationships, such as furloughed employees. Hiring new workers requires a more rigorous, and time-consuming, vetting process.

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, April bucked the reacceleration trend seen off the December 2020 low. Total payrolls still sit about 8.2 million below the February 2020 peak of 152.5 million, but we are still very optimistic about our ability to recapture the lion’s share of those losses quickly despite today’s disappointing readout.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.7.21-Blog-CHart.png?ssl=1))**

> “The job market got a bit of a reality check this morning,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we always caution against reading too far into one data release, we think most of the cited factors that suppressed April’s payroll number should wear off naturally with time. We believe that despite April’s speedbump the overall trend will be higher from here.”

> Given the magnitude of the total loss that still needs to be recovered and the varying degrees to which parts of our economy are currently open, we believe jobs data will carry the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Improving employment trends—though choppy—buoy consumer strength, and the economy overall, given consumers’ large weighting in the calculation of gross domestic product (GDP). As such, we continue to recommend positioning portfolios to take advantage of these trends, where appropriate, including an overweight allocation to equities relative to benchmarks, and a tilt toward sectors that may benefit more from a continued cyclical upturn

> # Let’s Talk About Stocks And Higher Taxes

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Cinco de Mayo!

> One of the big discussions lately has been about how will higher taxes potentially impact the stock market. We’ve known since President Biden won the presidency and the Democrats secured control of the House and Senate that higher taxes were coming, likely in the form of higher corporate taxes and higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy—though probably not until 2022. It is worth noting though that stocks haven’t been fazed at all by all the higher taxes talk, as we just saw the best first 100 days for stocks under a new president since FDR.

> With proposals for the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan (AFP) and $2 trillion plus infrastructure bill (known as the American Jobs Plan or AJP), higher taxes are needed to help finance the new spending. Let’s be clear though, with a 50/50 Senate (Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties) and historically slim Democratic majority in the House, we think these final numbers will likely come in less than $3 trillion combined, as these initial numbers from the Democrats are starting points for negotiations.

> Higher capital gains taxes on the wealthy are one way to pay for things, with the AFP proposing to increase the top tax rate on ordinary income to 39.6% from 37%, and capital gains and dividends taxes on those who earn more than $1 million to a maximum of 43.4% from the current 23.8%. Fun stat, only 0.32% of the population makes more than $1 million a year, so the truth is this won’t impact the other 99.68% of the population.

> “We’ve known higher taxes were coming so this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone at this point,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Now here’s the catch, looking back at the times that taxes increased amid a strong economy, stocks did just fine. Given the strong economic outlook this year, you’d have to think history could repeat once again.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, in 1986 and 2013, capital gains taxes increased, but the economy was on firm footing back then, compared with the 1970s hikes, which saw an economy marred by higher inflation and sluggish growth. Not surprisingly, the two more recent hikes saw solid stock market performance, while the 1970s hikes didn’t. Is it as simple as how the economy is doing? It very well could be.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Corporate taxes are currently 21% and President Biden has discussed increasing the level to 28%. Although we think in the end the level will be more like 25%, the bottom line is higher corporate taxes are likely coming, which could knock a few percentage points off of future S&P 500 Index earnings growth.

> So what happens after corporate taxes are raised? As the table below shows, muted returns a year out are normal, but interestingly stocks have consistently been in the green the three months before the official date of the tax increase, suggesting investors weren’t very worried about higher taxes on the horizon.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.5.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It’s always possible that higher taxes slowly take a bite out stock market returns over a longer time period than just a year, but if the concern is what all the talk about higher taxes may mean for markets over the next year, there’s not much historical evidence pointing to the potential for a bad outcome. The picture is murkier, though, with corporate taxes, which isn’t surprising, since stock prices are ultimately tied to earnings growth. But is often happens, markets seem to be more attuned to larger economic forces.

> # Individuals, Writers, and Managers All Still Bullish

> The major indices are broadly lower in the past week with the exception of the Dow which has risen just over 1%. The Nasdaq on the other hand has been the worst performer falling almost 3%. Even though the major indices are split in terms of performance, sentiment has gone the way of the Dow as bullish sentiment as measured through the AAII weekly survey rose 1.7 percentage points to 44.3%. While not a particularly large increase, this week did mark the first time bullish sentiment has risen in a month.

> With bullish sentiment higher, fewer respondents reported as bearish. Only 23.1% of investors reported pessimistic sentiment; down 2.6 percentage points versus last week's reading. Just like bullish sentiment, that was not a particularly large change, and it leaves the reading in the middle of the past several weeks' range.

> The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread climbing 4.3 points to 21.2. While that is still at the high end of the past few years' range, it is 11 points below where it stood only two weeks ago. Looking at another sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence which targets equity newsletter writers, the bull-bear spread also rose slightly week over week leaving the spread well below levels from only a couple of weeks ago. In other words, sentiment has moderated recently, but it has not dramatically shaken a historically bullish tone.

> Perhaps the most notable reading in this week's AAII survey was the reading on neutral sentiment. Up 0.7 percentage points from the prior week, it was not a particularly large gain especially compared to the 5 and 5.2 percentage point gains the previous two weeks. Regardless, moving higher once again neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the first week of March. Other than that week and the current one, there has only been one other week in the past year (second to last week of 2020) in which neutral sentiment was as high as it is now. Even though this week's reading is elevated relative to the past year, compared to the rest of the history of the survey, it is pretty unremarkable. On average over the life of the survey, neutral sentiment has averaged a reading just 0.9 percentage points lower than this week's reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/050621-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The NAAIM Exposure Index is yet one more sentiment reading that also has shown some moderation but remains at a generally bullish level. This index reflects the average exposure to US equities of members of the National Association of Active Investment Managers. Readings of 200 would indicate they are leveraged long on average, 100 would be fully invested, 0 would be market neutral, -100 would be fully short, and -200 would be leveraged short. Last week saw this index tip above 100 for the first time since mid-February which also ranked in the top 2% of all readings going back to 2006. This week it fell 15.93 points. That stands in the bottom decile of weekly moves and was the largest drop since late March, but at 87.79, the index still points to historically bullish positioning among active managers.

Submission,n9x0wl,Some Advice for Newer Investors from an Experienced Investor (5+Years),DontStonkBelieving,"Just thought I would drop a few suggestions in here as having invested for over 5 years I have found ways that have stopped me pulling my hair out during ""turbulent"" times such as these and hopefully can have some words of wisdom for newer investors:

1. Close the app, don't keep checking it every 5 mins or you will be impulsive and emotive in your choices. As humans we tend to follow the sunken cost fallacy and often can't comprehend these losses are only on paper.
2. Re-evaluate, if you are just trying to break even that is not good enough you need to have confidence this company's product will continue being innovative or respected and if you sell now you are essentially saying I do not think the pricepoint will ever be greater than it currently is (although if you see another opportunity that you think have a better future make sure to consider this more in depth). I sold PLTR because I honestly don't think it will break $20 in the foreseeable future and bought it off hype, I took a loss but it gave me the liquidity to pivot elsewhere.
3. WWW - What went wrong, work out the weak points of your portfolio and what can you do better, for me I had gone over my risk tolerance in order to chase gains. I needed to pullback a sec and diversify into stocks like Tupper and Crocs which were undervalued and had low P/E's rather than sticking to tech and the ""hot stocks"". If you have knowledge of what went wrong you won't start getting unjustly angry because of not understanding the losses and just seeing your savings slip away.
4. Remember that stock losses are temporary, I have had some dark days last few weeks but just getting outside and getting some fresh air has done me wonders, the whole market is down so don't beat yourself up over any mistakes, you only really need to worry if it is only your stocks dropping and there is no indication from the wider market.
5. Always remember ""Mr Market"" [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mr-market.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mr-market.asp) he is irrational, he is crazy but he can be your best friend. Logically it can appear good earnings may mean a raise in Stock Price but the market is always forward looking, if they can't guarantee future earnings or guidance it will go down, there is always a twist to the logic.
6. This is more for the more experienced investors but:  don't gloat and mock the newer investors, they are at least trying to do something new - the current system really screws over us younger people and I tip my hat to anyone trying anything different. I can only speak for myself but the investing culture didn't run through my family so I'm entirely self taught and I made a lot of mistakes. Don't beat them while they are down remember: we all had to start at one point.

Final PSA: The Stock Market is not for everyone, there is no shame in investing into an ETF or Bonds if life is in the way - I believe every investor has some element of fun when it comes to stocks in order to stay invested in the market. If it is never fun and is just an extra chore than it is probably not for you and you should have a more passive strategy.

Submission,ni2ty8,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 21, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterday’s rally. It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.
* In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.
* Snap (SNAP) said it will acquire WaveOptics, a British Augmented Reality company, for over $500 million. The company has recently been making a big push into the world of wearable AR technology.
* China's internet watchdog said on Friday that companies including ByteDance, Baidu, and Microsoft (MSFT) improperly collected user data in the country.
* Yesterday, the US Department of Treasury announced it was taking steps to crackdown on digital assets by requiring any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
* China’s Financial Stability and Development Commission, which is chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, released a statement today saying it is necessary to “crack down on digital asset mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.”

Submission,nb00oc,How bad do we realistically expect this dip to continue?,stevebeans,"I have a lot of tech stocks (please no lectures on diversify. I know. But I can't diversify when my holdings are thousands in the hole).

Anyway, my biggest holding (dkng) has gone down virtually 10 straight trading days. 1 of those were green but by 13 cents so not much of a gain there.

The problem is, I've been using margin to average down because I honestly did not expect it to get this low. I'm now pushing margin limits and need some expert advice. What to cut.

My biggest bag holders in order are...

DKNG (-23% down, $54.89 CPS)
PLTR (-19% down, $23.11 CPS) 
SFT (-15% down, $9.16 CPS) 
PINS (-13% down, $65.95 CPS)

DKNG is 55% holding, PINS is 22%, PLTR 8%, SFT 5%

Needless to say, DKNG is the problem. I'm holding a lot and it's down the most. I used to believe in the stock, but now I don't know what do believe.

So my question is...

Do I just cut the cord and drop dkng before it drops to $20-25. Do I cut PINS? I can get rid of PLTR AND SFT but that won't help my margin deficit much.

Or do I continue what I've been doing and shaving 10 shares at a time off either dkng or pins when margin gets close to max and just hope this crash stops soon?

Serious suggestions please. No lectures. I know my mistakes. I just need to figure out the best way to mitigate my losses.

Note - I don't need this money right now. I have another non-margin account that I never look at because I have all the time in the world for the stocks to rebound. But I'm racing against margin on this one so I'm wondering the best way to handle it.

# The Cash Flow Statement

The   main objective of the Cash Flow Statement (or Statement of Cash Flows)   is to explain how much and why the cash balance of a business changed   during the period of analysis.

**The cash flow statement is typically broken into three sections:**

* **Operating activities**
   * Detail   cash flow that’s generated once the company delivers its regular   goods  or services, and includes both revenue and expenses.
* **Investing activities**
   * Include   cash flow from purchasing or selling assets—think physical  property,   such as real estate or vehicles, and non-physical property,  like   patents—using free cash, not debt.
* **Financing activities**
   * Detail cash flow from both debt and equity financing.

>Based   on the cash flow statement, you can see how much cash different types   of activities generate, then make business decisions based on  your   analysis of financial statements.Ideally,  a company’s cash from  operating income should routinely exceed its net  income, because a  positive cash flow speaks to a  company’s ability to  remain solvent and  grow its operations.It’s  important to note that cash flow is different  from profit, which is why  a cash flow statement is often interpreted  together with other  financial documents, such as a balance sheet and  income statement.

**However, you will also find other information:**

* How much cash earnings the company had during the period, as contrasted with accrual earnings (in income statements)
* How much and where the company reinvested cash during the period to sustain and grow its business
* How much cash it raised from or returned to its debt and equity investors

The   Cash Flow Statement preserves the signs on cash flows, with negative   cash flows shown as minuses and positive cash flows as pluses. It also   looks at cash flows through the eyes of equity investors in the company.

**Positive cash flow**

* Indicates   that a company has more  money flowing into the business than out of  it  over a specified period.  This is an ideal situation to be in  because  having an excess of cash  allows the company to reinvest in  itself and  its shareholders, settle  debt payments, and find new ways  to grow the  business.
* Positive   cash flow does not necessarily translate to profit, however.  Your   business can be profitable without being cash flow-positive, and  you   can have positive cash flow without actually making a profit.

**Negative cash flow**

* Having **negative cash**   flow means your cash outflow is  higher than your cash inflow during a   period, but it doesn’t  necessarily mean profit is lost. Instead,   negative cash flow may be  caused by expenditure and income mismatch,   which should be addressed as  soon as possible.
* Negative   cash flow may also be caused by a company’s decision to  expand the   business and invest in future growth, so it’s important to  analyze   changes in cash flow from one period to another, which can  indicate how   a company is performing overall.

# Cash Flows from Operations

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy**](https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy)

**Working Capital**

Embedded in the cash flow from operations is the **change in working capital items, excluding cash**

* Non-cash Working capital = Non-cash current assets – Non-debt current liabilities
* An   increase in non-cash working capital will decrease cash flows, whereas  a  decrease in non-cash working capital will increase cash flows.

Non-cash   working capital ties up cash and capital, a firm with higher needs for   that working capital will have lower cash flows from operations, for  any  given level of net income, than a firm with lower needs.

# Cash Flows from Investing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8**](https://imgur.com/TYgP2y8)

**Operating or Non-operating Assets**

* The   investing activities section includes investments in both operating  and  non-operating assets, except for investment in liquid, close to   riskless securities, which is treated as cash & marketable   securities.
* The   investments into operating assets, whether internal (capex, net of   divestitures) or external (acquisitions of other companies) are the   engine that drives growth in the operating line items (revenues,   operating income etc.)

>*Note that acquisitions funded with stock will not show up here for obvious reasons.*

* The   investments into non-operating assets create a separate source of   value, where the payoff will not show up in the operating line items but   below the operating income line, as income from cross holdings or   securities.

# Cash Flows from Financing

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY**](https://imgur.com/JqZv2kY)

**Debt Cash Flows**

* While   interest expenses show up in the operating cash flow section, by   reducing net income and showing up in deferred taxes, debt repayments   are part of the financing section.
* To   the extent that some or all of these debt repayments are funded with   debt issuance's, the net effect on cash flows can be neutralized or   become positive.

>**If   total debt increases during a period, it will represent a cash inflow,   and if it decreases, it will be a cash outflow. Companies that embark  on  plans to bring their debt down (up) over time should therefore  expect  these consequences.**

**Dividends and Buybacks**

* Until   the 1980s, the only cash flow that was received by equity investors in   publicly traded companies was dividends. The effect of paying  dividends  is simple: it reduces the cash balance of the company and  increases the  cash in the pockets of every shareholder who receives  dividends.
* Starting in the 1980s, US companies have returned increasing amounts to their shareholders in the form of buybacks.
   * The effect of buying back stock is exactly the same as paying dividends, to the company, with cash leaving the company.
   * For   shareholders, though, the cash flow effect is disparate. Those   shareholders who sell their shares back get cash from the company, and   those that do not get no cash, but get a larger share of the equity left   in the company.
   * Both dividends and buybacks reduce shareholder equity on the balance sheet.

Submission,nnl4hk,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021",bigbear0083,"Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 31st, 2021.

# **A big jobs report looms in the week ahead, as markets enter the often-weak month of June - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/28/jobs-report-looms-in-the-week-ahead-as-markets-enter-the-often-weak-month-of-june.html)**
*****
> May’s employment report is the big event in the week ahead, as stocks enter the often weak month of June. Stocks are finishing May with a mixed performance. Big cap indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow notched gains. The S&P rose a half percent, and the Dow rose 1.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 was flat, up 0.1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.5%.
*****
> June is not historically a strong month for stocks. Bespoke Investment Group points out that over the past 50 years, the Dow has gained just 0.12% in June and has been positive 52% of the time.
*****
> But over the past 20 years, June was far weaker, gaining only 40% of the time. June’s performance is tied with September as the worst month of the year, with an average Dow decline of 0.7%, according to Bespoke.
*****
> The economy is front and center in the coming week with the important ISM readings on manufacturing and services sector activity, but the most important measure will be Friday’s jobs report. According to Dow Jones, economists expect Friday’s employment report to show the creation of about 674,000 jobs in May, after the disappointing 266,000 jobs added in April. That was about a quarter of what economists had expected.
*****
> “You know if we have two months in a row of not delivering on the jobs expectations, the market is going to get nervous,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Hopefully, we beat it and then that creates a positive buzz, and we go into the Fed meeting and then we’re, ‘Hey, the economy is still on track.’”
*****
> # Big June event
> The Fed meets June 15-16, and already market pros are anticipating it will be the most important event of the month. Fed officials have emphasized that they will keep policy easy as they watch to see signs that the economy is really healing. They also contend that higher inflation readings are temporary, since the data is being compared with a weak period last year.
*****
> Key for the markets is whether the Fed begins to believe that inflation is higher than it expected or that the economy is strengthening enough to progress without so much monetary support. Fed officials have said they would consider discussing tapering back on their quantitative easing bond purchase program if they see signs of improvement, and that would be a first step toward interest rate hikes, not expected until at least 2023.
*****
> If inflation runs too hot, the Fed’s main weapon to combat it is to raise interest rates.
*****
> The prospect of higher interest rates makes the stock market nervous, since it would mean higher costs for companies and less liquidity. In theory, higher interest rates also means that investors could potentially choose higher-yielding bond investments over stocks.
*****
> The next big read for the economy is Friday’s jobs report, and it looms large as recent inflation readings have come in much hotter than expected. The latest was the personal consumption expenditures price index Friday. It showed core inflation running at 3.1% year over year, the strongest reading for that measure since 1992.
*****
> The Fed’s beige book on the economy is expected Wednesday. ISM manufacturing data is expected Tuesday, and ISM services is released Thursday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on central banks and climate change at Green Swan 2021 global virtual conference Friday.
*****
> # Inflation flare-up
> The Fed has said it would tolerate an average range of inflation around its 2% target until it sees inflation sticking at a higher level. Inflation has been running mostly below 2%, prior to the latest numbers.
*****
> “With the PCE number coming in like every other inflation number over the last six weeks, hotter than expected, the market is inching closer to calling the Fed out on its view that inflation is transitory,” said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG.
*****
> Emanuel said the speculative activity around meme stocks this week is a sign of froth and shows a large amount of liquidity in the hands of investors. One of those stocks, AMC, closed off 1.5% on Friday after rallying 116% in the past week, giving it a 2021 gain of 1,200%.
*****
> “The net net on the index level is basically it’s a stock market that’s moving sideways,” Emanuel said. “Our view continues to be that when you look at it longer term, the big picture is this is a bull market that started in March of last year that has further to run. When you look at it in the medium term, the market has every right to be concerned and we do believe they will amp up their concern that the Fed’s paying insufficient attention to price stability.”
*****
> Emanuel said he studied what happened to stocks when core PCE was above the Fed’s 2% target. “The average monthly return for months where the core PCE has been over 2%, going back to 1989 is (a decline) of 1.6%, with a decided bias toward more defensive sectors like health care outperforming and a very pronounced bias for technology of all kinds to underperform,” he said.
*****
> Technology stocks, as measured by the S&P information technology sector, gained 1.6% in the past month, and are up 5.9% year to date. The sector is lagging the S&P 500′s 12% gain.
*****
> The top-performing sectors have been cyclical year to date, with energy up 36.2%, financials up 28.5%, materials up 20.1% and industrials up 18.3%. Communications services, which contains some internet growth names, gained 16% since the start of the year. Health care has been outperforming information technology, up 8.6% year to date.
*****
> In the past week, the S&P 500 gained 1.2% to 4,204 and is within 1% of its all-time high. The Dow rose 0.9% to 34,529, and the Nasdaq was up 2% at 13,748.
*****
> # Red flag?
On the edges of the financial markets, market pros are paying attention to signs of a huge surge of liquidity in the financial system. In the past week, institutions have been placing unprecedented amounts of cash with the Fed, nearly a half trillion dollars Thursday.
*****
> “There’s way too much liquidity in the system, and it’s happening as a result of the Fed’s ongoing QE, but also disbursements from the fiscal stimulus,” said Goncalves.
*****
> He said the funds from trillions in stimulus, including to state and local governments, have not yet been spent but have found their way into the banking system. At the same time, institutions and individuals continue to move funds into money market funds, now holding about $4.6 trillion.
*****
> Those funds also put pressure on the system, since they put funds in Treasury bills. Goncalves expects the Fed to raise rates on excess reserves if the situation gets worse.
*****
> “There’s no precedent for this because it is totally a function of there being just too much money in the system,” he said.
*****
> “Institutions are redepositing cash at the Fed because they don’t have enough bills or short-term commercial paper. There’s not enough fixed income assets to go around,” said Goncalves. He said banks also do not want to hold the excess cash since it counts against their leverage ratio, and they would prefer to find other higher-yielding investments.
*****
> What it has done is sparked some speculation that the Fed would taper its QE program sooner than expected, he said.

> # Days After Memorial Day Improving

> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 31, 2021. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

> For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive.

> Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, but S&P 500 declined five straight days after 2015-2019. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%.

> # Checking the Gauges: Economic Surprise Indexes

> In terms of whether economic data is either beating or missing economists’ forecasts, it appears conditions may now be a bit better overseas. Driven by some improving COVID-19 trends, the economic backdrop has improved overseas, while high economic expectations have proved to be a more formidable hurdle here in the U.S. This improvement has helped to steady the foundation in many non-U.S. equity markets, and has caused us to improve our outlook for developed non-U.S. stocks. We believe the improving COVID-19 trends in Europe could be particularly sticky as vaccine distribution becomes more widespread.

> For several years now, being underweight European equities, relative to the U.S., has been a winning trade. A sea-change in that thinking could be approaching as value-heavy European indices have gotten some attention with the improvement from value, but a firm, constructive view of European equities may still be some ways off.

> The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, or CESI, tracks how the economic data fare compared with expectations. The index rises when economic data exceeds Bloomberg consensus estimates and falls when data is below forecasts. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, economically, global conditions remain rather strong, as evidenced by these indices, which remain above the zero line. This reflects economic data coming in better than expected in several geographic regions. The repair of global trade activity, as supply lines are reconnected, has been notably key in non-U.S. data outcomes.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/blog-chart-5.27.21.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking ahead, we expect now elevated economic expectations, particularly in the U.S., may prove a tougher target. As a result “economic surprises,” both in the U.S. and abroad, may fade as we move through the year. However, the overall global growth trajectory is expected to continue to be robust through 2021. Global real GDP contracted 3.3% in 2020, and it is expected to rise to +6.0% in 2021, according to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, before ticking down to +3.4% in 2022.

> “Although high U.S. economic expectations could be tough to beat for the remainder of 2021, we still believe U.S. stocks should make up a material portion of equity portfolios. And even though economic expectations are being more readily exceeded overseas, it is tough to overlook U.S. companies’ innovation and profitability advantages.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> # More and More Investors Are Looking For A Correction

> The S&P 500 has been hovering around 0.5% below its record highs this week, but without a true test of those highs, sentiment has not moved very far. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment fell from 37% last week down to 36.4%. While that is the second week in a row with an absolute move less than a full percentage point in size, the marginally lower reading does leave bullish sentiment at the lowest level since the end of October.

> Bearish sentiment moved by even less, only rising 0.1 percentage points. At 26.4%, it still is below the reading of 27% from the first week of the month. Outside of that reading, that is the highest level since February.

> Pivoting over to sentiment for equity newsletter writers measured in the Investors Intelligence survey, there were some more interesting moves. Bullish and bearish sentiments were not necessarily anything to gawk at similar to the AAII survey. Bullish sentiment has been on the decline with this week's survey showing a 3 percentage point drop to 51.5%, the lowest level since March 10th. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment moderated from 17.2 to 16.8%. That was the same level as the start of the month.

> The percentage of respondents ""looking for a correction"" was more notable. Rather than simply asking whether or not respondents foresee a correction in the technical sense on the horizon (a 10% decline from a high), Investors Intelligence defines a newsletter writer as ""looking for a correction"" when they are bullish on a list of stocks but at a lower price point. Coming in at 31.7%, the reading is a few percentage points above the historical average of 27.6% and is in the top quartile of the historical range. In other words, it is an elevated reading albeit far from without precedence. What is more significant is that it has been over a year since this part of the survey has seen these levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052721-II-Correction.png))**

> In the history of the survey dating back to 1963, there have only been eight other times that the percentage of newsletter writers looking for a correction has crossed above 30% for the first time in at least a year. The most recent of these was in April 2009. In the table below we show the S&P 500's performance in the year following those occurrences. As shown, performance has been generally positive across those past instances with average gains over the following weeks and months and moves higher at least 75% of the time one month, three months, and one year out. Additionally, while there were two times, 1982 and 2009, in which the S&P 500 rallied over the following year without looking back, there were another two times, 2001 and 2007, that at the following years' lows, the S&P 500 would end up lower by double-digit percentage points.

I hope you all have a wonderful Memorial Day weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",,,23,t3_nnl4hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nnl4hk/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/,151,0.96,[1622286144.0]
Submission,nn7etx,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 28, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 28, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with market participants encouraged by new economic data on consumer spending, income and inflation, and a strong Weekly unemployment report. The market has made a remarkable recovery, particularly in technology, after the market tumbled 4% following the April Consumer Price Index roughly two weeks ago. In my view, as I have said for weeks, the recovery in the market confirms that the initial sell-off driven by inflationary fears forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected was overblown.

New government data on Friday showed personal income fell less than expected in April, but still pulled back after March's stimulus-fueled surge. Personal income fell by 13.1% in April compared to March, less than the 14.2% drop expected. This follows a 20.9% increase during March which had been buoyed by the distribution of $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans. 

In another report, the Department of Commerce reported core personal consumption expenditures increased 3.1% in April from a year earlier, blowing past the Fed’s traditional 2% target. Federal Reserve members consider the core PCE to be the gauge of inflation. The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. Supply-chain constraints combined, labor shortages in certain industries, and rising demand as the US economy recovers from the coronavirus-induced recession have all contributed to higher inflationary readings. These are all factors that are widely considered transitory, meaning not permanent. In an April 28 statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, “An episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not likely to lead to persistent year-over-year inflation into the future. Clogged supply-chains won’t affect Federal Reserve policy because they’re temporary and expected to resolve themselves.” Moreover, he said “For inflation to move up in a persistent way that moves expectations up, that would take some time, and you would think it would be likely we would be in very strong employment for that to happen.” In other words, Powell is saying he expects issues driving inflation higher to resolve themselves moving forward and doesn’t expect inflationary pressures to materialize until the labor market further improves.

In remarks this week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Fed, offered a slightly different view but one that is in-line with what the Federal Reserve has already said publicly in the past. Clarida said, “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

Submission,nfrmgh,Worst buys you’ve made this year so far,ZhangtheGreat,"I’m new to investing, and like any new investor (except for the ones who are super lucky beyond comprehension), I knew I was bound to make a few poor purchases here and there, even with all the research I did before I made my first purchase. So far, there are only three buys I regret:

3) INTC - This has turned out to be a surprise disappointment at this time. In my pre-entry research, Intel had a reputation for being a safe, reliable company that would continue to steadily climb. Unfortunately, after about two days of small gains, Intel has done nothing but tumble. Still, I’m optimistic for its long term because it’s Intel, so I’m holding it.

2) MRNA - Chalk this one up to bad luck. I bought Moderna to chase its earnings report, but the timing couldn’t have been worse: I got in literally MINUTES before the Biden administration announced that the US wouldn’t protect COVID vaccine patents. In a snap, MRNA tumbled 20 points, and to add insult to injury, its earnings report disappointed. Thankfully, it’s only 5 shares, but I’m stuck holding them until MRNA can climb back to 178 again.

1) TSLA - Chalk this one up to being a total n00b. I bought TSLA on my 5th day in the market. I only had enough for one share, but I had to have it. Tesla had been surging for two straight days, and it looked poised to surge again for a third. I was thinking “easy $15 at least.” It turns out I wound up buying it at its peak. Since then, my one share of TSLA has tumbled $200, and with its unpredictability, who knows what direction it’s headed in? My stubbornness refuses to cut this loss, and a balanced portfolio that is gaining more than losing is allowing me to hold this share with the blind belief that it’ll see 800 again.",,,640,t3_nfrmgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nfrmgh/worst_buys_youve_made_this_year_so_far/,151,0.95,[1621386045.0]

In comparison, Beyond Meat (BYND) currently sits at ~ 6,8 billion USD market cap.

Both have similar revenue. In 2020 Oatly’s revenue was 421,4 million USD. Beyond Meat’s 2020 revenue: 406,8 million USD. 

How does it makes sense that OTLY has almost double the market cap of BYND? Especially considering that Beyond Meat has a bit more specific (harder to replicate) product. It seems that many conpanies could produce plant milk if they wished so.

Submission,n8zkio,"PSFE (Paysafe): A better way to bet on multiple high growth companies like DRAFTKINGS, BARSTOOL, FORTNITE, TWITCH, YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY, ETC.",vegancash,"Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers/partners like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\_the\_bear\_case\_on\_paysafe\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)

(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including discussion of bear cases, so I’m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)

Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don’t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it’s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.

But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it’s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.

Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:

1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - “Penn National’s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.” ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )
2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - “DraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance”

(Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )

3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- “Revenue increased 16% to €2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from €1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year….” (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))

4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - “ In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter — up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That’s an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It’s also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )

5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - “Revenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.” (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )

As you can see these Paysafe’s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).

Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer’s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe’s future growth:

1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.
2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.
3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet. These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ (more on this below)

Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:

Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) “ Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv” (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )

Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) “Square reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.” ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))

So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don’t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \~$100 Billion. If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.

In summary, I think Paysafe is a low risk / high reward stock compare to other fintech. Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has. This is a massive high growth area and they own the space. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.

Submission,nhzaus,Amazon is shutting down its Prime Now fast delivery app,coolcomfort123,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-prime-now-fast-delivery-app.html

Amazon said it's discontinue its stand-alone Prime Now app and website this year.

The service launched in 2014 as a way for Prime members to get one- or two-hour delivery on a range of goods, from household essentials and books to toys or groceries.

Submission,nflbtz,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 18, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. 
* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it’s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

Submission,nk7ipu,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 24, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it’s important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed’s targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, “I do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.”

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year.

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren’t unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week’s sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown.

Seems like after the recent run of gains we are seeing some profit taking across the board. I see no real reason for the dip given that new economic data released today was overwhelmingly positive. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for May’s Job Report slated to be released tomorrow.

Amid negotiations with Republican lawmakers regarding the proposed infrastructure bill, today, the Washington Post reported that President Biden was open to reconsidering his previous proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to from 21% to 28%. This proposed increase has been one of the main sticking points during negotiations. Now it is reported Biden would recommend a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 

We got two pieces of good news in the labor market today. On one hand, according to a report by payroll processing firm ADP, the private sector added 978,000 jobs in May, well ahead of consensus estimates of 650,000. On the other hand, according to the Labor Department’s Weekly Jobless claim report, showed 385,000 new jobless claims, roughly in-line with 387,000 estimate and a fresh pandemic low, a great sign that the labor market is improving as the economy continues to recover. 

These reports set the stage for the official May Jobs Report set to be released tomorrow by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which will be critical in determining the pace of economic recovery and whether the Federal Reserve will consider tapering monetary support in the near future. The April Job Report was extremely disappointing, showing only 266,000 jobs added compared to the 1 million expected, and marking a sharp deceleration compared to March. 

**Highlights**

* Extremely volatile trading continued in AMC, which saw it’s stock price recover from roughly 30% down to more than 10% up and only to dip again towards the end of the day. Other “meme stocks” traded in similar patterns after rocketing up in the last few days. 
* AMC issues and additional 11 million shares today, with the company taking advantage of its surging stock price. 
* Boeing Co Chief Executive Dave Calhoun on Thursday pointed to potential ""supply constraints"" beginning in the summer after a ""more robust"" recovery from the coronavirus-related downturn than he had imagined, another sign that demand is catching up in many industries faster than supply as the economy roars back from the coronavirus-induced recession.
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. 
* Jack Ma's Ant Group has been approved to run a consumer finance company, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said Thursday. This is one of the first step of Ant's forced restructuring after China pulled the plug on its $35 billion IPO in October 2020. It also means the company will be regulated more like a traditional financial entity, giving authorities more oversight over company operations

Submission,nikw11,Want to invest in biotech? A quick guide.,carlyslayjedsen,"Short answer: don't. I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch it with a ten-foot pole. If you want to invest in the pharma/biopharma/biotech industry, investing in small-cap biotech stocks - MBIO, VKTX, ATOS, etc. for examples is basically gambling. Here are the alternatives I suggest.

Supply chain. TMO and AVTR are the two biggest suppliers of consumables in the life sciences industry and essentially hold a duopoly. Both are basically trying to position themselves as the amazon of the industry. TMO is more diversified offering various services and high-powered equipment and is on the cutting-edge of R&D in a lot of equipment fields (MS and cryo-EM). AVTR owns VWR which is basically like an Amazon/costco hybrid for companies and academia. I highly recommend choosing one or both.

Equipment. TMO/AVTR kind of fall into this category but I wanted to make a different section because they pretty much own the entire consumables market. Instrumentation has a lot more competition. While something like TMO has its hands dipped into everything, almost nobody would choose a TMO HPLC over Agilent (A) or Waters (WAT). PCR? Bio-Rad (BIO). Centrifuges? Beckman Coulter (DHR). A lot of companies have carved out niches for themselves whereas something like TMO is a generalist. You also have companies like DHR that hold brands like Beckman Coulter that have a lot of brand loyalty.

Services. CROs like IQVIA, PPD, manufacturing services, instrumentation (calibration, maintenance) services etc. One of the most expensive things about the industry is the regulatory hurdles, especially clinical trials. CROs help companies save money on clinical trials by outsourcing them to companies already equipped to handle different parts of them. Equipment has to have records of being ""up to spec"" for audit purposes and a lot of companies do this stuff in-house or let the vendors send service techs out. You also have companies like TMO with their unity service that do this stuff. They also recently bought out Patheon and PPD so they're expanding the services side of their company a lot.

Tech. This sort of falls under equipment and services so I won't spend too long on it, but companies like Illumina have revolutionized things in their fields (DNA sequencing for Illumina).

In terms of innovation in tech/equipment, chromatography, mass spec, sequencing, cryo-EM and Big Data are the future.

Big pharma/biopharma/biotech. You can still benefit from the excitement of a positive clinical trial result without the volatility. The issue with small-cap biotech is that you'll bleed out 70% over the course of a few months, and by the time you get that 25% bump from a positive trial result you're still extremely deep in the red. These companies completely hinge on a very small amount of drugs which is why they're such a gamble. Companies like PFE, ABBV have blockbuster drugs under their belt that keep them relatively stable and allow them to pay dividends. The 25% bump from a positive result you'd see from biotech is buffered to be more like 5-10%, but at least you know you won't (probably) lose 90% of your investment.

Last but not least... ETFs. Pharma, biotech and medical devices ETFs all hold a lot of these aforementioned categories/companies.

Submission,nhbg63,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 20, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 20, 2021**

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today’s movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

Submission,na1ok6,Today's interesting Pre-market.,alttoby,"Today's premarket was definitely... interesting to say the least. I opened up my Yahoo finance app and saw literally all of the holdings in my speculative portfolio down anywhere from 4-12 percent. Specifically both $OPEN and $PLTR were down more than 10 percent (PLTR down that much initially after the earnings report). 

Lo and behold, the market opens and everything immediately is up way higher than in pre-market. Now obviously futures are only indicative to some extent and don't actually reflect at which price-point stocks will open but it still leaves you wondering how PLTR can drop more than 10 percent in pre-market off the earningsreport and currently later in the day is trading up more than 8 percent. 

I don't buy all of the tin-foil hat theories that people have come up with since the whole GME saga but damn this is still kinda sus. I mean someone with premarket access could've scooped up some palantir shares this morning in pre-market and be up more than 20 percent within a matter of hours.

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor’s said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts’ expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation — rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago — the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.”

The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.

Submission,ndsxx7,AT&T ($T) in talks to combine media assets with Discovery ($DISCA),Social_History,"The Wall Street Journal reports that AT&T is in advanced talks to combine media assets, including CNN, with Discovery to consolidate their industry against incoming attacks from streaming.

The article states that T shareholders will maintain a large stake in the new entity. It’s unclear (at least to me) whether these media assets will be a new company altogether or be a part of Discovery.

Perhaps this suggests some of these media assets will push into cord-cutting and streaming, further suggesting the end of linear TV.

The deal is likely an attempt for HBO Max and Discovery + to form a giant conglomeration that can take on Disney + and Netflix. AT&T owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT, and Warner Bros. Studios. Discovery owns Food Network, HGTV, TLC, and Animal Planet.

Submission,ncihqg,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 14, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 14, 2021**

Stocks continued yesterday’s momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Fed’s commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

Submission,na6vzl,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 11, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 11, 2021**

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to close to break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed’s argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory” and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve.

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable).

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million….isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company’s history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn’t have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities…

Submission,nsg2cm,"GTHX a DD; note this DD is about 3 months old, no changes have been made for events of the past 3 months",KSInvestor,"G1 Theraputics

History:

G1 Theraputics is a newer drug company that develops and commercializes various therapies primarily relating to the treatment of cancer and cancer related symptoms. It was founded in 2008 and went public in May 2017.  

G1 has three main drub candidates; lerociclib, rintodestrant and trilaciclib; plus one newer as yet unnamed drug. 

Lerociclib (a drug with no current assignable value, but possible future payments):

The first drug candidate, lerociclib is being tested for multiple possible uses, however G1 has entered into agreements with EQRx, Inc and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc, such that these companies with test and commercialize the drug. Genor Biopharma Co. Inc has rights to commercialize this drug in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan; while EQRx Inc has rights to the rest of the world, including the USA. In return for ceding the testing and commercialization of lerociclib, G1 received payments of 26 million and could receive up to $330 million in additional milestone payments in the future. 

It is unclear at this stage in G1 will ever receive future payments for this drug, it is unclear when these payments might occur, and furthermore the amount of money under consideration ($330 million) is fairly small when compared to the possible funds from G1's other drug candidates.  However, the companies that purchased the rights to the drug did already pay 26 million for those rights, so its likely they see significant possible future value in the drug.

Thus, taking all these pieces of info into account, this report assigns this drug a fairly conservative future value of 20-30% of the possible future payments, or 67 to 133 million dollars. This payment must be discounted as it may not start for 3-5 years and would likely continue over several years. So, if this possible future revenue is discounted by 8% for 8 years (0.54 multiplier) this gives a current value to G1 of 36 to 72 million dollars.


Rintodestrant (G1's 2nd drug, some possible future value):

With regards to the 2nd drug candidate, rintodestrant, G1 is currently testing this drug for use in patients with  ER+ or HER2- breast cancer. Beast cancer accounts for about 30% of all cancers in females, in the USA.  About 65% of breast cancer is ER+, which means that estrogen mistakenly signals the cancer to grow and sometimes even protects the cancer from the body's own immune system. To combat this there are several possible treatments but for many of the cancers, a class of drugs called SERD's has proven to be very effective often when other treatments fail.  SERD's promote ER degradation which can have many anti-tumor effects, again primarily in use with cancers that have shown a resistance to other drugs.

Currently only one SERD, fluvestrant (a competing drug sold by AstraZeneca) is approved for use though several other SERD's, including the G1 candidate, rintodestrant, are being tested.  G1 began a phase I test of rintodestrant in 2018 and presented data from this test in 2019 and 2020. Based on the results of the phase I test, rintodestrant is likely (though as yet, not proven) to be more potent in binding and degrading ER, which would lead to faster and more complete degradation of tumors.  Additionally, rintodestrant has been observed to have a lower incidence of adverse effects, no severe side effects as well as no observed toxicity or bradycardia (bradycardia refers to an abnormally lowered heart rate). Furthermore, rintodestrant is easier to administer as it can be given orally (fluvestrant is administered by injection).

Based on the successful phase I results, G1 is now conducting a phase II trial of rintodestrant when used in combination with another drug, Palbociclib.   Palbociclib is a drug developed by Pfizer and the trial is of course being conducted with agreement from Pfizer.  The results of this trial should be made public in the 2nd quarter of 2021 ie within a few months.

Regarding assessment of the current value of rintodestrant, there are several problems.  First off, there is a competing drug, fluvestrant, currently being used and other competing drugs currently being tested. While rintodestrant appears to have various advantages over fluvestrant, the main possible advantage would be that its is more potent and though rintodestrant does appear to be more potent (based on the completed phase I trial), this has yet to be fully proven. Additionally further testing of rintodestrant will take several more years and finally, the current testing of rintodestrant is for use in combination with another drug, Palbociclib, and its unclear how revenue would be shared between these 2 drugs if any revenue ever occurs.

The current drug being used in these cases of breast cancer, fluvestrant, had 2020 worldwide sales of 580 million.  In a best case scenario, rintodestrant would take over most of these sales, and these sales have room to grow. However, even in the best case this would not occur for 3-5 years or more, and much of the sales would likely still go to Pfizer if their drug, palbociclib, was used in combination with rintodestrant.  

It seems likely that rintodestrant is a more potent drug than fluvestrant (based on the phase I trial) and also seems likely that rintodestrant has no major side effects and fewer side effects than fluvestrant. It thus seems fairly likely that rintodestrant would eventually replace fluvestrant in large part if not completely, if no additional drugs show up that are even more potent than rintodestrant.

Thus I am estimating an optimistic assessment of the future income stream for this drug (if there ever is one) at about 350 million per year starting in 3-5 years. This represents the current revenue stream (with room to grow),  but discounted for the possibility that the income is shared to some degree with Pfizer.  I am further estimating the likelihood that G1 is able to realize this income stream at about 30% (of course there is also a strong possibility they will realize a lesser amount of income).  This 30% represents the chance that rintodestrant is more effective than fluvestrant (it probably is), is well received and able to mostly or partially replace fluvestrant (it probably will, if it is proven to be a better drug), and finally that no competing drugs quickly emerge that are still more effective than rintodestrant (unlikely, but who knows).

Thus, 30% of 350 million means a expected future income stream of about 105 million, starting in 3-5 years or more, but of course, taking some years for the income stream to reach full strength even if everything goes well.  Discounting the income stream at 8% for 6 years (0.63 multiplier) leads to a present value of the income stream of about 66 million, which equates to a current value to G1 of between 133 million and 200 million (assuming a revenue multiplier of 2 to 3).

Trilaciclib (G1's third drug which has far higher potential)

Though G1 has a few other possible drug candidates (one in particular) they are considering, its difficult to assign any value to these currently untested drugs. Thus, G1's third and final drug of note is Trilaciclib. 

Trilaciclib has been tested and continues to be tested as a drug to be used to reduce myelosuppression (ie protecting the bone marrow which can be greatly suppressed by chemo) in patients receiving chemotherapy to combat diagnosed cancers in the body.  Trilaciclib has already been fully tested (thru phase 3) and proven to be effective in reducing myelosuppression in SCLC (small cell lung cancer) patients. Based on this SCLC testing, G1 has received from the FDA a positive PDUFA decision on February 21, 2021 (3 weeks ago).  This means that patients receiving chemotherapy treatment for SCLC can now receive Trilciclib (which is marketed under the tradename Cosela) as part of their treatment.

Regarding the positive effects of triciclib as proved through testing, by protecting the bone marrow from chemotherapy, triciclib reduces the rate of hematologic adverse events including neutropenia (a condition caused by a reduction in certain types of white blood cells which in turn reduces the body's ability to fight infection), anemia (reduction of red blood cells), and thrombocytopenia (reduction of platelets in the blood).  This means patients can receive longer duration chemotherapy treatments and often still have fewer side effects. Also, the immune system functions better than chemotherapy without triciclib and thus the body's own immune system is sometimes better able to help combat the invasive cancer and its effects.  Also, the reduction of chemotherapy side effects equates to generally shorter hospital stays with fewer problems which can save considerable money for the patients and insurance providers.

To see how widely used triciclib would likely be, G1 interviewed prescribers and found that 77% were extremely enthusiastic, very enthusiastic, or somewhat enthusiastic about the possibility of using triciclib with their patients.  

In their testing, G1 found that patients living with SCLC and receiving Cosela took 100% to 200% longer to report adverse symptoms including extreme fatigue (7 months with Cosela versus 2.3 months with a placebo), tested anemia (7.2 months with Cosela versus 3.8 months with a placebo) and overall functional well being (7.6 months with Cosela versus 3.8 months with a placebo).

Finally, the average treatment cost for a patient with chemotherapy who does not experience a grade 3/4 hematological event is a whopping $67,800; while the cost with a grade 3/4 event is approximately $90,100 (with Thrombocytopenia), $96,000 (with Anemia) and $131,000 (with neutropenia).  Thus, the helpful effects of Cosela might be such that the insurance companies would be happy to pay $8500 (the approximate cost each cycle of chemo) for the Cosela treatment to hopefully greatly reduce the average treatment cost and the incidence of a grade 3/4 hematological event which carries even greater costs which are enumerated above.

Regarding the approved SCLC treatment for triciclib and the income G1 can expect from it.  Approximately 30,000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC every year and of this number about 22,000 receive chemotherapy treatment. Patients who receive chemotherapy need an average of 4 cycles of chemotherapy treatment.  Cosela costs $1417 per vial, but patients require 2 vials per dose, 3 doses per chemotherapy cycle, and 4 chemotherapy cycles, on average. Thus, the total cost is $8502 for the average patient for one cycle of chemotherapy, which equates to $34,008 total average cost (with the average 4 cycles of chemo), per patient. With about 22,000 people being treated for SCLC, this equates to a potential income stream of about 770 million per year (this assumes most SCLC patients will eventually be using Triciclib which is what G1 appears to be projecting or at least hoping will come to pass).  This, in turn, equates to an approximate value to G1 of between 1.54 billion to 2.31 billion assuming a revenue to value multiplier from 2 to 3 (which might be a very conservative multiplier considering the drug is approved and sales have commenced).

In addition to approval for use in patients with SCLC, G1 is now testing, or has announced testing, for triciclib with patients of several other types of cancer including first line colorectal cancer, triple negative breast cancer, neoadjuvant breast cancer, bladder cancer, and non small cell lung cancer. Some of these tests are well underway, some are recently started and some have been approved but not yet started.  

Though G1 has to test its drug on each type of cancer seperately, the mechanism by which triciclib protects the bone marrow is the same regardless of the type of cancer and for almost all types of cancer (and all types that G1 is currently testing) the drug functions in a completely different part of the body (the bone marrow) as where the cancer is located. Thus, if triciclib works well for SCLC cancer, then it is likely it has approximately the same effects and symptoms as with other types of cancer, with the exception of cancer which is specifically located in the red bone marrow - a small subset of all cancer types.

Furthermore, since G1 has already received approval for triciclib with one type of cancer, testing on cancers in other parts of the body can be somewhat sped up as some of the results/ information from the SCLC testing can be easily applied to testing for other types of cancer. Thus, so long as G1 tests carefully and receives no unexpected results (again they know what the results will probably be from the SCLC testing), it will probably be easier to get future approvals for use with other types of cancer.  Essentially G1 has to simply run similar trials to what they ran for SCLC and prove that they get similar results, but its already expected that this will be the case since the functioning of the drug should have nothing to do with the type of cancer being tested (so long as the cancer is not in the bone marrow, where the drug functions).

Currently, G1 is in phase 3 testing for one type of cancer (colorectal).  They have recently begun or will soon begin (within the next 3 months) two separate phase 3 tests for 2 types of breast cancer. They are in phase 2 testing for an additional type of breast cancer, and they recently began or will soon begin phase 2 testing for bladder cancer and Non-SCLC lung cancer.  Several other studies, for more types of cancer are planned for 2021.  Though some of these studies (at least the one for colorectal cancer) will likely complete in 2021, drug approval and thus revenue from these studies may not begin until 2022, but all of these studies may be completed and approved within 3 years, possibly less.

In aggregate these trials that are underway or soon to be underway are for cancers diagnosed far more frequently than SCLC, with patients of these types of cancers receive chemo at the rate of about 470k per year, while SCLC patients receive chemo at a rate of about 22k per year.  However, its not clear that all patients receiving treatment for these cancers would qualify for treatment via triciclib and other problems could emerge so to be safe it would be best to ut this number by about 1/3rd, so 313 thousand patients per year. Thus, the potential revenue stream from these other types of cancer, combined would be about 313.33/22 = 14.24 times as large as the potential revenue stream from SCLC alone. This could (using the same numbers as for SCLC) eventually amount to income of 10.96 billion per year which would in turn equate to a value to G1 of between 21.92 and 32.88 billion.  

Finally, people in other parts of the world also get cancer, and G1 has many patents and several agreements with other companies for these companies to commercialize triciclib in other parts of the world, though G1 themselves still have the rights for most of the world, outside the USA.  It will likely be years before triciclib reaches much of the rest of the world, in fact it will be years before triciclib is accepted for most types of cancer in the USA, assuming this approval even comes.  Still, there is huge potential for this drug outside the USA, as well.


Other G1 Data

Looking at other data beyond G1's current drugs, G1 had 207.3 million cash on hand at the beginning of 2021 and said that they expected their cash on hand to last them through 2022. Of course, if triciclib sales are well underway for SCLC by the end of 2021 then they may never need to raise additional cash.  G1 has also raised some licensing revenue in 2021 and this would further reduce chances they need to raise additional cash, down the road. Because the entire 207.3 million will likely be used to fund future drug testing, no credit will be given for it in this analysis of the value of G1, but this does mean there may be no concern about G1 having to raise more money and dilute there stock in the future.

One other interesting item of note regarding G1.  Some of the earlier founders of the company have moved on to pursue other goals and the whole process of getting their first drug approved has taken years (G1 was founded in 2008, and went public in 2017). Thus G1 may be open to a takeover from a larger drug company, though G1 must realize the vast potential of triciclib. So, there is a chance that G1 could be taken over by a larger drug company, though G1 shareholders might actually be better served if that never happened, possibly making far more money by simply holding on and waiting for the revenue from triciclib to start arriving.


Valuation Summary

So, in summary, G1 has an estimated value of $169 million to $272 million from lerociclib and rintodestrant.  They have an estimate value of 1.54 billion to 2.31 billion from the approved use of their primary drug, triciclib, though sales of this drug just started so it make take a year, or so, for this revenue to show up.  

However G1 has future potential future value of between 21.92 and 32.88 billion from the additional currently underway tests for triciclib, though they probably won't receive any additional revenue from these other types of cancer for a year, possibly more, and won't realize this entire revenue stream for 3 years, possibly more.  They have even more potential revenue from still more testing of their drug with other types of cancer and from commercialization of their drug overseas.

G1 has a current share price of $20.43 and a current market cap of $857 million.  Assuming a 1 year value of 1.7 billion to 2.58 billion (the estimated current value for lerociclib, rintodestrant plus revenue from the SCLC approval for triciclib at a multiplier of 2 to 3), this computes to a current stock value of about $40.50 to 61.50, within about a year (as the revenue for use of triciclib with SCLC starts coming in).  So, about a 98% to 201% return in 1 year. 

However, if all current triciclib tests go well and everything moves along without problem, then G1 may be able to grow triciclib's revenue such that their stock value is from 21.92 and 32.88 billion in 5 to 7 years (assuming about 3-4 years to complete all testing and an additional 2-3 years for revenue to reach its full potential).  Additional revenue from overseas sales is possible but that would just be icing on the cake and its difficult to make an educated guess at what that revenue might be within 5 to 7 years. This gives G1's stock an estimated 5 to 7 year value of about 25.6 to 38.4 times its current value (857 market cap divided by estimated future stock value).  

This last number may actually be conservative, but there are also quite a few things that can go wrong in 5 to 7 years.  Also, there is a decent chance the company will be taken over which would mean an excellent short term return, but nowhere close to a 25.6 to 38.4 bagger.

Possible Near and Distant Catalyst to G1's stock price going up.

At any time they could be taken over by a larger company that sees potential in their Triciclib drug (and other drugs to a lesser extent).  Longer term (1 year) they should see revenue growth from their one approval for Triciclib. Down the road (probably 5 to 7 years) they may get approval for Triciclib for many other types of Cancer and could see massive revenue from this which could cause their stock to go up many times over its current price.

There are risks to this investment as with any other and there will be up's and down's and its not clear if any price movement will occur for as much as 9 months, or more, but I personally think this stock will eventually rise to many times its current valuation, if everything goes well.  You do need a 5-7 year time horizon (possibly more) for this one, and even then its a risk.

As of now the only way Russians can buy spce is from the St Petersburg exchange. St Petersburg is known to buy company stocks and re-sell them without the permission of the company… 

April 2018: 
“Under Russian securities laws, a Russian stock exchange can unilaterally admit foreign securities to trading without the consent of the issuer of such securities. In the last several years, the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange admitted securities of a number of foreign companies to trading in a similar fashion.”

So big investors don’t trade there for that reason.. they could be forced to sell their shares, and when they buy shares they have to pay “extra” on them. Our Russian friends always complain about the stock price, when they try to buy we post one number… they see another “higher to buy” lower to sell etc… because of a “delay”.

Anyways, if you noticed during the flight many Russian investors attended the after party of SPCE. Then days later SPCE announced they’ll officially list in the Moscow exchange. 

Is this a coincidence? No. Russian investors are interested in this company, next week we will see “fresh” money buying shares and holding them.

Also, for those who’ve invested for several years, have there been any stocks from your past that fit this category? If so, what did you eventually do with those stocks?

I’m only less than two months into my investing journey, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but my top three so far are…

3) MA - Talk about a stock that swings wildly. At its peak, MasterCard was as high as +300 for me. At its bottom, it fell to almost -200. Right now it’s sitting at around -100. I saw MA’s chart before I bought, and I noticed the wild price swings, but I also saw the general upward trend of higher highs and lows, which is why I’m not worried about its ability to eventually recover again.

2) SBUX - The stock was climbing from the moment I bought it…until its earnings report. Then it recovered. Then it didn’t. Yet despite its ridiculously high P/E ratio, it’s Starbucks. Its brand is as loud as Coca-Cola or Disney. I doubt it stays down for long.

1) OPY - When I was trying to find undervalued stocks, Oppenheimer’s numbers made it an attractive buy. Then the recent panic over inflation hit, and OPY wasn’t immune from the fall.

Submission,n9g4gq,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 10, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 10, 2021**

Stocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary pressure and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, its worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.

Market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting he said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Looking ahead, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens.

Further spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from “overheating”. She said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she seemingly downplayed her remarks, saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, “Let me be clear, that’s not something I’m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.”

While it may seem like doom and gloom, this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldn’t begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating. Last Friday, the April Job Report reported only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020. The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon, with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report coming in far below estimates, the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soon.

In short, a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020, and while substantial progress has been made, economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, remains far from complete.

**Highlights**

* Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary.""
* The trial between Epic Games vs Apple (AAPL) has commenced. Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer's hit video game ""Fortnite"" from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices by trying to make their own market place within the app store. Epic Games also sued Alphabet on similar grounds. Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in Europe filed by Spotify (SPOT)
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials on a semiconductor shortage that has cut production, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
* No price target increases today, technical issue on our end :(

*****
> Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting.
*****
> May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected.
*****
> Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January.
*****
> Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%.
*****
> But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market.
*****
> “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention.
*****
> “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC.
*****
> “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.”
*****
> Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said.

> The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814.
*****
> # Watching the inflation signs
> Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory.
*****
> Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year.
*****
> “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.”
*****
> He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed.
*****
> “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.”
*****
> Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market.
*****
> Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected.
*****
> Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking?
*****
> “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca.
*****
> # Taper talk
> The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying.
*****
> After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023.
*****
> Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities.
*****
> “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.”
*****
> For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said.
*****
> There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday.
*****
> G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

> # May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold

> Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors.

> One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery?

> Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions.

> It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways:

> * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs.

> * The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%.

> * Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases.

> “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.”

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.4.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well.

> The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy.

> Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief.

> For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released.

> # Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months

> S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October.

> We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend.

> # June Swoon?

> Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June:

> * Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse).

> * It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s.

> * The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month.

> * According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June.

> * Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%.

> We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings.

> Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate.

> # Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks

> Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Neut.png))**

> With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Cons-Above-20.png))**

> Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

> # Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month

> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps.

> # Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade

> The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

> In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift.

> “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

> Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound.

> # S&P 500 Returns Relative to History

> May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928.

> We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Current-vs-Avg1.png))**

> The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Percentile-Rank1.png))**

> Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window?

> For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Submission,n7chm7,Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returns,vgambhir,"Recent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ?

Submission,ns4pf4,U.S. Job Growth Picked Up Steam in May After Disappointing April,Johnblr,"U.S. job growth picked up in May and the unemployment rate fell, signaling firms are making some progress filling a record number of openings as the economy powers up.

Payrolls increased by 559,000 last month after a revised 278,000 gain in April, according to a Labor Department report Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 675,000 rise. The jobless rate dropped to 5.8%, while the labor participation rate was little changed.

Long-term Treasury yields are little changed, the dollar declined and U.S. stock futures moved higher.

The payrolls gain leaves the U.S. labor market 7.6 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels. A broader improvement in the labor market requires faster job growth among service providers, like the leisure and hospitality industry, that have suffered a more lengthy disruption from the health crisis.

Submission,nqvshl,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 2, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**

The three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. 

The month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called “meme stocks” that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.

New economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management’s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers “continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand”, noting that “record lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.” As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. 

However, it’s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* The U.S. said Wednesday it will impose tariffs on the U.K. and five other countries in response to their taxes on U.S. technology companies, but will suspend the levies for six months as it seeks to negotiate an international resolution.
* Tesla Inc is recalling nearly 6,000 U.S. vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose, with the potential to cause a loss of tire pressure, documents made public on Wednesday show.
* Twitter Inc said Tuesday it will begin testing ads on its disappearing posts feature called Fleets, as it works to offer more options for advertisers. The company previously said it set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023 from last year's levels, which it plans to achieve in part by selling ads on more parts of its site and mobile app.
* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. 
* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.

Submission,nlr7pv,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 26, 2021",psychotrader00," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

AVIR - Atea Pharma

\- Is a biotech company which focuses on oral antiviral drugs, main focuses are covid (e.g. treating people who caught the virus, not the vaccine) which is in Phase 3 of testing (should hear results in the next few months, but already licensed to Roche) and Hep C (much earlier stages). What caught my eyes is that they became profitable this year, and they earnings are estimated to grow massively \~90% and generally seems to have reached all time low of around \~$22 vs an ATH of almost \~$90 

&#x200B;

CRSR - Corsair

\- Gaming and streaming equiment, another company that seems grossly undervalued. They have had a massive 2020 thanks to Covid which is expected to keep growing as the gaming industry in general. After a strong rally post IPO, where it reached an ATH of \~$50 is currently sitting at $30 and generally sees to have a pretyt low P/E ratio.

Submission,n9jkf3,Trying to find the next big growth stock is absolutely moronic and a good way to lose money,donemessedup123,"Since the 2020 bull-run, I have been seeing a rising trend on social, and especially on Reddit, of people looking to buy deep into speculative stocks. It seems that each individual small-cap growth stock that is at least remotely known has some cult-like following attached it, convinced it will be the next FAANG.

Aside from some the obvious points, such as small-cap growth being prone to manipulation and pump n dump because of their small market cap, the historical data really shows picking winners is next to impossible. 

According to a 2018 quantitative research report from Hendrik Bessembinder, the best performing 4% of listed companies drove the entire returns of the stock market since 1926. The remaining 96% of stocks collectively were outperformed by US Treasury Bills. Statistically, you are likely to be better off not investing your money than you would be taking your chances on 96% of the stock market. 

Your odds are even worse when you go hunting for the 1,000+ listed U.S. small-cap growth stocks. You have better chances of finding a needle in a haystack. 

I cannot understand how this mindset of ""finding the next Amazon"" has taken such great hold and now everyone thinks their ""DD"" is completely infallible if they ""believe in the stock"" and ""hold it long term."" Confirmation bias, survival bias, and the endowment effect have run rampant, and a lot people who do not know what they are doing are going to (or already have) lost a lot of money they cannot afford to lose.",,,84,t3_n9jkf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n9jkf3/trying_to_find_the_next_big_growth_stock_is/,75,0.77,[1620690253.0]
Submission,nky43y,My big bet on Molson Coors Beverage Company ($TAP),DuderCurious,"**$TAP**

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait for the suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events. This obviously cut into earnings last quarter and yet they still beat estimates. My guess is that so long as they don't have any enormous and unexpected events during Q2, they are going to crush earnings.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it is now starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.
2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called ""Going ALL IN on $TAP""
3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called ""Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson""

Submission,nh02hb,What is the benefit of a company issuing a one-time special cash dividend?,SnailingThroughTime,"I own a decent amount of shares of FutureFuel Corp ($FF). The company released quarterly earnings reports a few weeks ago and revenue was down quite a bit. This led to the stock dropping about 15%. A day later the company announced they would be paying out a one-time special cash dividend of $2.50 per share. Obviously this is a pretty crazy high amount of money to pay out per share. In response to that announcement, share price rose about 30%.

What confuses me is what benefit a company would gain from doing this? I am not complaining about the payout, but it seems like the timing of the announcement was to offset the poor quarterly earnings report.

Submission,nbqhfy,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**

The wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday’s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed’s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents.

Would like to hear some counterarguments before I begin to go on a shopping spree; I’m sure many users here know way more about this than me and can provide some great food for thought. Thanks in advance. 

Basically, a lot of growth stocks have been pummeled mainly due to A) sector rotation into reopening plays and B) fears of inflation. The first has no tangible impact on a company’s fundamentals. The inflation hysteria does makes sense, as a lot of growth stocks tend to reinvest excess cash flow and that makes them more vulnerable to interest rate movements. 

But with many of these growth stocks currently being decimated by levels of 50% or more, you have to wonder how much of that is priced in, and should inflation normalize over the coming months, these stocks should see a pretty massive jump in positive sentiment. I’m pretty confident that inflation fears are a nothingburger, making this an excellent entry point for someone like me who has withheld a lot of gunpowder on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to invest during a tech correction. If inflation does turn out to be a more long-term issue then, again, the stocks are already down 40-50 percent. Don’t see how much more they can reasonably fall.

Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Submission,n70krq,Is Beyond Meat (BYND) a buy after the recent dip?,Tedi_Westside,"**Company Description:**

Beyond Meat is one of the fastest growing food companies in the United States and offers consumers a range of various plant-based meats. This company’s mission is to build meat directly from plants and have their final product consist of the same attributes as actual meat products. Beyond Meat’s products are designed to be more nutritional than that of regular meat, although the nutritional aspects of plant-based meats have been questioned. While plant-based meats may or may not be more nutritional than regular meat, by shifting to plant-based meats people can positively affect growing global issues. The issues which this company is trying to address include human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources, and animal welfare. Their products consist of the Beyond Burger, meatballs, sausage, beef, and more. Besides certain Beyond Crumbles, all of their products are certified Kosher and Halal. As of December 2021, you can find Beyond Products available at approximately 122,000 retailer and foodservice outlets in more than 80 countries. In addition, Beyond Meat has an e-commerce site which offers consumers bulk packs, mixed product bundles, and trial packs. This company is constantly innovating and their R&D as a percentage of revenue is higher than some of the biggest food companies (Nestle, Kroger, etc.) at 7.8%. Their state-of-the-art innovation center is a 30,000 sq. foot building located in El Segundo California. This company’s mission is simple to understand, through a unique and innovative approach make the best product that gets as close as possible to real meat all while benefiting the planet.

**Total Addressable Market** (TAM)

In 2020 the plant-based meat market was estimated to be valued at $4.3 billion and is projected to reach $8.3 billion by 2025. All that growth registers a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14%. Much of the growth that we are witnessing is due to the growing vegan, vegetarian, and health conscious trends people are adopting. Also, many people are becoming more aware of the additives that are in the foods that they eat and the environmental problems that come with meat products. All of these factors make Beyond Meat products appealing as not only do people enjoy knowing they are eating healthy, but they can do their part toward slowing down environmental problems. While the plant-based market may not be the largest, Beyond Meat said they are going after the global meat industry. The global meat industry is valued at $1.2 trillion and had a CAGR of 2.4% between 2015 and 2019. Perhaps the biggest discrepancy between these two industries besides how the various products are made and consist of is price. Beyond Meat’s Beyond Sausage sells for $10.30 a pound, that is about 70% more than regular pork sausage. One pound of factory-farmed beef burgers at Walmart run somewhere around $3/pound, while one pound of Beyond Meat’s Beef Burger will run you around $6.25/pound. While the difference in pricing is certainly a lot, that doesn’t mean that people don’t buy Beyond Meat products. Going forward we’ll have to see how much of a disrupter this company is to the global meat market.

**Recent Developments/Acquisitions**

**The new Beyond Burger launches at grocery stores nationwide (April 27, 2021) –** Beyond Meat recently introduced their new Beyond Burger which has 35% less fat and saturated fat, and fewer calories than 80/20 beef. This new iteration will hit grocery store shelves beginning the week of May 3rd. It will be available in a 2-pack, the brand’s first ever value 4-pack, and a 1lb Beyond Beef pack. Dariush Ajami, the Chief Innovation Officer at Beyond Meat, said ” We are continuously working on understanding beef flavor at a deeper level to ensure our plant-based beef platform delivers a delicious and satisfying sensory experience. The new Beyond Burger’s rich flavor profile resembles that of ground beef, and extensive testing with our consumers validated this new flavor direction with likeability scoring on-par with 80/20 ground beef burgers.” According to the University of Michigan’s 2018 Life Cycle Assessment, when compared to traditional 80/20 beef burgers, the Beyond Burger has 99% less impact on water scarcity, 93% less impact on land use, requires 46% less energy, and generates 90% fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

**Beyond Meat announces major retail expansions throughout Europe (April 12, 2021) –** Beyond Meat announced that they will be significantly increasing product distribution within thousands of European locations. The plant-based foods market in Europe has seen sales grow by 49% over the last two years. In the U.K, Sainsbury’s said they would double their distribution of the Beyond Burger nationwide. Also, Waitrose launched the Beyond Burger and Beyond Sausage. The retailers together increased Beyond Meat’s presence in 445 stores. In Germany, Beyond Meat will be expanding their product offering in over 1,000 German retail stores through Kaufland, Tegut, Famila, and Real. In Austria, the Beyond Meat product selection will be expanded at SPAR and BILLA locations to a total of 1,500 retail stores. Migros stores in Switzerland will expand Beyond Mince distribution to 155 stores. Nearly 1,000 Albert Heijn and Jumbo stores in the Netherlands will now offer Beyond Mince. Chuck Muth, the Chief Growth Officer at the company, said “These new and expanded retail partnerships throughout the continent serve as strong proof points that Europe’s appetite for plant-based meat and Beyond Meat products in particular is on the rise.” Moreso, in June 2020 Beyond Meat announced its first co-manufacturing facility in Europe in partnership with Zandbergen World’s Finest Meats in Zoeterwoude Netherland.

**Beyond Meat opens manufacturing facility in China to accelerate localized production and innovation (April 7, 2021) –** Earlier last month Beyond Meat opened a new advanced manufacturing facility in the Jiaxing Economic and Technological Development Zone located near Shanghai. Ethan Brown, CEO, said “The opening of our dedicated plant-based meat facility in China marks a significant milestone in Beyond Meat’s ability to effectively compete in one of the world’s largest meat markets. We are committed to investing in China as a region for long-term growth, and we believe this new manufacturing facility will be instrumental in advancing our pricing and sustainability metrics as we seek to provide Chinese consumers with delicious plant-based proteins that are good for both people and planet.” Just a little over a year ago, Beyond Meat entered mainland China through a nationwide partnership with Starbucks. In addition to Starbucks, Beyond Meat has partnered with multiple other food services such as KFC, Pizza Hut, Jindingxuan, GangLi Beijing, Slow Boat Brewery, Hema, METRO China and more. Beyond Meat has been expanding so heavily in China that they’ve even made a product specifically for the Chinese Market, Beyond Pork.

**What could go wrong**

**Foodservice doesn’t pick up –** Beyond Meat has a number of strategic partnerships with restaurant chains in various countries. In the past we’ve seen that whenever they announce a new partnership with a food chain their stock jumps dramatically, only to fall back to where it was before a few days after. Beyond Meat has partnered with the likes of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, KFC, and a number of other restaurants. Looking at the foodservice side of their business, they’ve seen tremendous YoY growth. While Covid has impacted their business significantly in terms of foodservice sales, many investors still remain optimistic that this side of their business will bounce back. While they will likely continue seeing growth going forward, I remain skeptical as to how all these strategic partnerships will play out. Impossible foods is their main competitor and they’ve partnered with the likes of Burger King, White Castle, Red Robin, and others. These partnerships with respect to both companies have played out well as shown by the YoY growth in foodservice revenue. The questions that remain to be asked are, in the long-run, how many of these restaurants will create their own meat alternative products or stop doing business with Impossible foods or Beyond Meat? Taco Bell has already begun testing their own plant-based protein products and how many others will follow? Furthermore, Beyond Meat has been relying on new partnerships to boost foodservice sales. There might be a point to where the growth in foodservice revenue stops as a result of their not being worthy partnerships with restaurant chains and what happens then? Nonetheless, I remain optimistic for the time being that Beyond Meat will see their foodservice revenue increase rapidly for the next couple years.",Company Analysis,,65,t3_n70krq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n70krq/is_beyond_meat_bynd_a_buy_after_the_recent_dip/,70,0.93,[1620399812.0]

Submission,nqplrb,The pretense of knowledge: my bear thesis.,shortyafter,"***""The future is better foretold in the streets than in the morning news""***

One thing I'm exploring lately is how people on the ground tend to have a better read on things than ""experts"".  Obviously this is not always the case, and I think when it comes to things like Covid and stuff it's best just to follow the restrictions and what not.  But immunology is deeply rooted in science, and is easily testable.

I have a degree in economics, so I'm not one to sling the profession through the mud.  But I think that some economists are attempting to bring a degree to certainty to the field that simply is not realistic.  F.A. Hayek talked about this.  Economist William White, who predicted the '08 crash, also talked about this.  I'm not the only one saying it.

I recently read in a book, *The Shadow of the Wind,* by Carlos Ruis Zafón, a passage that struck me.  I will provide the original text in Spanish, for those who speak it, as his words are far more beautiful than my subpar translation:

*""Era un buen lector de la historia y sabía que el futuro se leía en las calles, las factorías y los cuarteles con más claridad que en la prensa de la mañana""*

*""He had a good read on the future, and he knew that the future was better foretold in the streets, in the factories, and in the troop quarters than in the morning news.""*

&#x200B;

**The '08 Crisis**

When the real estate bubble burst in '06, and the financial system came toppling down in '07-'08, economists and central bankers were left scratching their head.  They would eventually say that it was impossible to see this coming, but in the [Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf), they debunked this, and said that there was plenty of warning.

People on the ground at mortgage originator firms saw it coming.  Consumer advocacy groups saw it coming.  People at ratings agencies saw it coming.  But at all levels they were ignored.  There was an assumption that somehow, via technology and financial engineering, we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigm.

But Michael J. Burry saw it coming.  He was a bit of an outsider, and it's no surprise to me that he would be the one to take a wider look at things and say, ""wait a minute"".

Peter Schiff saw it coming.  I have mixed feelings about him, as he has strong (and oftentimes incorrect, IMO) political views.  But what I like about Schiff is that he doesn't pull any punches.  He didn't buy it when Bernanke said ""subprime is contained"".  A lot of people did.  The market did.

&#x200B;

**2021 - Anecdotes from the ground**

My mom traded in her car yesterday and she told me she was surprised that the were willing to give her $11,000 for it.  It wasn't in bad condition, but this amount was surprisingly high to both of my parents.

She told me that a year or so ago they took the car into the shop because it was making a funny noise.  They paid a lot of money to have it checked out, but no problem or solution was found.  My mom mentioned this to the people at the dealership, and they even took it for a test drive.  No problem.  They were willing to give her the full $11,000, no more questions asked.

To me this looks like speculative behavior.  Used car prices are going through the roof due to, not only decreased supply, but more importantly to *increased demand*, with so much free money sloshing around in the system. And since prices keep going up and up, the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it, regardless of the state it was in.  Sound familiar?

How about Warren Buffet saying he's seeing massive price increases all across the board?

What about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub? Look at the meme stocks.  Look at Archegos.  Look at Tesla.  Speculation is running rampant right now.  Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say ""let's not overcomplicate it, it's goin' north!""  Ie, the trend is up right now, so it's going to keep going up.  What in the world kind of analysis is that?

In addition, the S+P 500 hasn't had a serious downturn since 2008... remember, stocks always go up, right?  Covid doesn't count.  It barely scratched the market, and the rebound has been insane.

I follow a channel on YouTube called Everything Money (highly recommended, this sub won't let me link it).  The main analyst, Paul, has been investing since just before the dot-com bubble.  He knows that it's NOT normal for stocks to always go up.  This guy isn't an economist.  He's not a new investor.  He's not some pundit.  He's an investor who has been battle-tested.  He's a guy on the ground.  He knows this isn't normal.

&#x200B;

**The Stubbornness of Ineffective Paradigms**

In my own job as an English-as-a-foreign-language teacher, I have seen how many teachers stubbornly cling to ineffective methods that don't work.  I had one friend today tell me that ""this is coming from a place of ignorance, but I don't think their method of focusing on grammar works"". I told him, in this case, your ignorance is more insightful than their ""expert"" methodology.  He is correct, as my best students are those who do less grammar and have more exposure to real English.

It is the teachers who think they have to micromanage their students' learning who simply end up getting in the way.  We can't engineer the ability to speak a foreign language... all we can do is provide contact to it, and just like a baby learning their native tongue, eventually it starts happening.  Yet teachers cling to the false notion that it is through their deliberate efforts that students will learn.

And if such an ineffective paradigm can persist so stubbornly in this environment, why not in others?  How about the war on drugs?  Can we simply force people to stop taking drugs?  Does it make any sense?  No.  But people don't like to change their views - they cling to them.  And I believe economists, the Fed, and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market, and as long as we make the right adjustments (via QE and fiscal policy), we will be OK.

F.A. Hayek would call this ""the pretense of knowledge"".

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I don't know what's going to happen, and hey, I could be wrong.  Maybe stocks will always go up and we'll just avoid any major crises from here on out.  It could happen.

The issue is that the bulls and the central bankers never even seem to posit the idea that ""hey, I could be wrong"".  To them it's science.  Physics.  Math.  That's the economy; that's the market.

But the market is not science.  We can do our best to try and understand it, but IMO, part of having a true understanding of it is realizing that we will never be able to figure it out entirely, and then planning our policies in such a way that takes into account our limitations.

I'm predicting that this situation is not sustainable, and I'm predicting that we are going to see some sort of crisis in some ways comparable to 2008.  I believe that ultra-easy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis.  I also believe that inflation will be a problem, and perhaps a serious one.

I'm not shorting anything because I recognize that I could be wrong.  I'm still learning and developing my theory every day.  But I am playing things very, very conservatively.

I am going to take the step to post this, because by taking a position I will either learn through being correct, or learn by being proven wrong.   The worst thing anyone can do is take no position at all and neither succeed nor fail at anything, and thus guarantee that they never learn or advance in any way whatsoever.

Submission,nhpkn0,Is it worth it to invest in multiple shares of Coca Cola for Dividends?,FlamingOrange,"I am a new investor and while I am learning more every day and looking into stuff more and more, Coca Cola has caught my eye. Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue chip company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue chip company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff like the rip-toe currency stuff (can't say it because word filters are stupid), and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think

My comparison, my portfolio right now is:  
2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)  
3.02 shares of V (Visa)  
1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)  
2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)  
(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE.

I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

Regarding owning shares its no big deal. We get little training videos about how we are not supposed to trade on insider information and how we are not supposed to trade shares just before and after earnings but other than that, no problem, anyone can own company's shares and I don't think you need to declare anything to HR. Also, we have shares ownership programme where employees are allowed to buy company's share at a discount. I think it's buying shares at cheapest price that quarter or something like that.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

  My stock is Kaleyra (KLR). Its an Italian company, a competitor of Twilio but in its infant stage. Its a very undervalued tech play as well: its valuation is only  $380 million, compared to Twilio's massive $52 billion. Why do I pick Kaleyra, instead of Twilio, or any other competitor? It operates as a bridge in the communication process of  App-Cloud-Message-Customer. A simple SMS from your bank app or Uber happens thanks to a company like Kaleyra.  Also provides communications involving chatbots, verification process, voice messages, Whatsapp messages, you name it.   Its a sector that keeps growing more and more and has significant barriers of entry. Here some points: 

\-It has a prices-to-sales ratio of 2, yes, only 2!. 

\-Kaleyra operates mainly in Europe, India, and its gaining ground in the US thanks to a very recent acquisition. It has a lot of know-how in the financial industry.

\-It is cash-flow positive. 

\-It has among its clients Twilio. Yeah, its main competitor has been its client. Plus other 3500 enterprise customers. 

\-It got its debut last year in Wall Street. With the acquisition of Mgage, its projected to double its revenue in a year or less. The stock price has suffered lately, no bad news whatsoever, just affected by the market in general and shorters: 15% of its stocks are shorted. 

\-Twilio is the absolute leader of this sector, with a better growth rate and better margins. However, a company like Kaleyra, with such a small valuation and great growth prospects, offers a potential multi-bagger possibility in a shorter time. Next earning report is next Monday.

Submission,nlznbj,Jeff Bezos' remarks on Andrew Jassy as the new AMZN CEO (in his final shareholder-meeting as the leader).,Karnes,"“He has the highest of high standards and I guarantee Andy will never let the universe make us typical,” Bezos said during the meeting, which was held virtually for the second year in a row, due to the coronavirus pandemic. “He has the energy needed to keep alive in us what has made us special.”

Bezos was asked whether Amazon will have any trouble innovating now that it has grown so large and diversified. He acknowledged that Amazon under its new leader Jassy will have to manage newer bets that have no guarantee of being successful, including its Amazon Care telehealth service and Project Kuiper satellite internet network.

“Let me assure you, I can guarantee you that none of these ideas are guaranteed to work,” Bezos said. “All of them are gigantic investments and they’re all risks...The only way to get above-average returns is to take risks and many won’t pay off. Our whole history as a company is about taking risks, many of which have failed and many of which will fail, but we’ll continue to take big risks.”

Submission,njc9ur,"Cruise stock holders, when are you selling?",squiglesthesquirrel,"I bought CCL/CUK (Carnival Corp) starting late April last year and made it 100% of my portfolio. Now it is up around 100% (mostly long term gains) and I recently reflected if my hypothesis for the stock was seen through.

Frankly I did not expect to hold so long. I bought expecting a faster return to normal and if I knew in advance they wouldn't sail in the US until July 2021 I would assume it would be a bad investment. 

However, now they are confirmed to sail in July. I guess the hype that is left would be the cruises actually sailing successfully, and then the announcement of what they will do with their reserve cash ($11.5 billion compared to their usual $1 billion or less). They have around $26 billion in long-term debt (compared to $9 billion before the coronavirus) so I imagine it is a priority to pay off that. Then there are expenses of getting the cruises prepared to sail and upkeep. 

So even if CCL were to pay off $10 billion (maybe not the best use of funds) of their debt they would still be $6 billion more in debt than before the coronavirus with their dividend gone and shares heavily diluted.

In fact, their market cap is practically the same as it was pre-covid. In December 2019 they had a run up but the market cap now is actually higher than it was in November 2019. It would require billions in stock buybacks for the share price to rise to it's pre-covid levels (which included a dividend), on top of the billions needed to pay for debt/upkeep. Not to mention CCL was actually in a downtrend from 2018 on, with the market cap going from $50 billion to $30 billion.

So why would I hold now? Even if they have a successful year I'm having trouble justifying why they would continue to grow and outpace the SPY. 

Any other cruise stock holders? I've already started shifting money into a different investment that I have higher conviction will return healthy gains.",Industry Discussion,,71,t3_njc9ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/njc9ur/cruise_stock_holders_when_are_you_selling/,56,0.83,[1621790263.0]

Submission,n80bmo,Alibaba: A Short Analysis,y_angelov,"**What does Alibaba do?**

First and foremost, they are an online commerce platform. They sell retail, they sell wholesale, they sell single items, they sell container loads of items. This also includes a logistics platform and global fulfillment network, Cainiao Network, and an on-demand delivery and services platform, Ele.me. Then, they also have a rapidly expanding cloud business in addition to some small entertainment, gaming and other business units, but in this analysis I'll mainly focus on the online commerce and the cloud business as they are the two pillars of Alibaba's business strategy.

So, let's look at the online commerce. Is it doing well? Well? It's doing fantastic! The last year, it grew by 35% YoY! Over the last 5 years, online commerce sales increased by almost 500% from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020. To give you an idea, 1 US dollar was roughly 7.08 RMB then so Alibaba's online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly $61.5 Billion. Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing! In fact, this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is. Then, the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22% to 165 billion RMB or $23.4 billion. So, how are they doing THAT well? Simple! They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic, but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020. They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users. Essentially, they've got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINED!

So, Alibaba's online marketplaces include several websites, but not just any websites. In fact, the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN. THE. WORLD. Tmall and Taobao. Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place. The company presence is just mindboggling. And, to top it all off, the business model is much lighter than Amazon's, for example. Why? Well, Alibaba does not sell its own products, it doesn't have any inventory, doesn't have any warehouses, which results in less expenses and a higher net profit. How much higher? Well, Amazon's latest net profit margin is 5.53%. Alibaba's? 24.71%!

So, the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibaba's amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings. In fact, the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money, although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable, but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform. Now, the cloud computing is different. In the 4th quarter of 2020, it finally broke even! It is an important part of Alibaba's long-term strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it. In 2020, cloud revenues grew by almost 62%! Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that way.

Overall, the company is growing fast, roughly 38% increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70% in the last year! We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well. How are its financials though? Well, it has a lot of cash, roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy. In fact, they've got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares. In the final quarter of 2020, they repurchased roughly $110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly, but they've approved a share repurchase plan of between $6 and $10 Billion. If we see them acting on that plan, investors could get very excited! So, the business is growing fast, the financials look solid, they're starting to return money to the shareholders. What about their price?

Well, the company is relatively cheap right now. Their PE ratio is 25.5 with a forward PE of 20.6. Historically, they have a PE average of 34.5 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now. Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so there's that. Compared to their direct Chinese competitors, Alibaba's PE isn't actually that low, but I'd say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business. Also, if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments, we can see that Amazon's PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 137.2, way higher than Alibaba! Amazon's PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibaba's! Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020.

But, they've also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them. Basically, we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal, at least in my opinion. It's no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY (Yahoo finance screenshot). Also, most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them. It's got better sales, better net profit margin, better brand presence, better long-term strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo, Vipshop, JD. Clearly, it's the better deal, at least in my opinion, but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well. Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20% of his Daily Journal portfolio.

Now, this stock just looks to good to be true, right? Sort of. Alibaba does have some issues, but they're of slightly different nature. The main risks involved with the company are more... political. First of all, you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military, that don't provide proper financial statements and reporting, that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government. Now, technically speaking, just because a company is delisted doesn't mean that you cannot trade it, but chances are that its stock price will be hurt... A LOT. You'd still be able to trade it over-the-counter, but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers won't support it. I know that my broker, eToro, does not. Still, you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibaba's stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The ticker is 9988, but it's essentially the same stock. Personally, I don't think that's going to happen, but don't take my word for it. Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delisting.

That isn't all though. Currently, there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies. Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma, its founder, made criticised the Chinese government's approach to financial regulations. As a result, the IPO for Ant Group, which is essentially Alibaba's spin-off that deals with consumer financing and lending, was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered. More recently, more regulations and restructuring was ordered. While this has affected Alibaba's business model to an extent, the regulations have also affected Alibaba's direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage. The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of $2.8 BILLION US dollars, the biggest one ever handed... so far. They also ordered the company to stop its anti-competitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms. So, are the regulators finished with Alibaba? Well, we can only speculate. The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses, which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies. They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies, but as I said this is not something that you can know for certain.

So, what's the verdict? Is Alibaba a good investment right now? Personally, I think so. It is undoubtedly risky, but the company offers such amazing prospects that it's just crazy to miss out on. I mean, if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price, wouldn't you? I'd recommend doing your own research into it, but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and that's why it is my second largest holding and almost 10% of my total portfolio. 

Finally, Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen. There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it, hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectory.

That's my analysis on Alibaba. There's a lot more to talk about, but I wanted to keep it on the short side. What do you think?

Submission,nsf89v,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 4, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**

Stocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.

The Labor Department’s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a “string” of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, “What I see here is somewhat of a ‘goldilocks’ overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important."" 

Recent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was ""still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we’re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.""

* Square (SQ) is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin, CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a tweet. (Jack Dorsey is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter)
* GE CEO Larry Culp says the deal to combine its jet-leasing unit and GE Capital Aviation Services with rival AerCap (AER) remains on track to close later this year or early next year. 
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona.

Submission,nq4hhj,FaceBook bearish sentiment,PennyStockWorth,"Facebook short play. (Put options)

It’s safe to say a large percentage of the revenue Facebook makes is from iPhone users… because iPhones are the most popular cellphones in North America. (N/A highest consumer market)

IOS 14 update asks users if they want to allow apps to track their data. Most people will click ask app not to track, and you’ll notice in the days to come that most of your adds are less and less targeted. 
(Facebook did a study that shows 2% of users allow the app to track data, that’s 98% loss of continuous data collection, see link at bottom of page)

I think in Q2 when Google and/or Snapchat report earnings beating analyst expectations, people will price in Facebook doing so as well as they always follow trend.
When FB reports Q2 earnings, it will show up on the month of June. This will create lots of bearish sentiment against Facebook, additionally with inflation being in that talks this summer, the tech industry can see a hit.

Facebook should still be able to generate revenue from targeted ads, as they have data stored already. Although, as new trends and products enter the market, Facebook will lose its advantage as it’s stored data will be out of date. 

To add more…
Facebook has been trying to attack apple using every angle they can think of, even saying the new IOS update will “hurt” small businesses… that to me, shows me how desperate Mark Zuk is and how much this update will hurt Facebook.

Submission,npua3e,"SCR | The Next Great, Canadian, Tech-Enabled Opportunity 🚀🍁",NameInsertedHere,"Hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of theScore's BIGGEST catalyst.

The stock is traded on the NASDAQ & TSX under ticker: SCR

**Some context on the company and it’s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**

TheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It’s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.

This engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They’ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.

TheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They’re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.

theScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they’ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.

TheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They’ve built their “Fuse” and “Bet Section” as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore’s features. When they’re ready to finalize their bet, they’ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.

The New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they’ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they’ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.

theScore, like all other sports betting companies is currently sitting at a negative EBITDA. They reported a loss of (17.5 M) in the last quarter. This is because we are still in the early days of a high-growth industry. Companies have to get passed all of the free promotions and incentives that are offered, Market entry costs, etc and then they have to retain their users to start seeing profits. They reported a handle of 81,6 million, a 491% YoY increase, with Net gaming revenue being ($2.4M) and a media revenue of $8.0 M, a 17% increase.

theScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won’t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they’re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won’t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it’s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.

**So, what’s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**

The Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.

Last week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.

Tomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.

The bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).

The opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada’s leading mobile sports media brand.

10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million

The current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock’s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR’s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.

**Bonus info about eSports:**

\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch

\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL

\- There’s a potential for \~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years

\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.

eSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who’s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?

**TLDR:** PEOPLE LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They’re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories.

Legalization of Canadian Sports betting is expected in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. 🚀",Company News,,27,t3_npua3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/npua3e/scr_the_next_great_canadian_techenabled/,52,0.71,[1622554756.0]
Submission,no1uzz,Apple’s massive success with CarPlay paves the way for automotive ambitions.,Karnes,"'Apple introduced CarPlay in 2014 as a way to integrate the iPhone and a car’s dashboard. Since then, it’s become ubiquitous in new cars.

Around the world, over 80% of new cars sold support CarPlay, Apple said last year. That works out to about 600 new models, including cars from Volkswagen, BMW, and Chrysler. Toyota, one of the longest holdouts, started including CarPlay in 2019 models.

It’s also a top feature for many drivers and car buyers. Twenty-three percent of new car buyers in the U.S. say they “must have” CarPlay and 56% percent are “interested” in having CarPlay when buying a new vehicle, according to a 2017 Strategy Analytics study. When Ford’s highly anticipated electric F-150 goes on sale, it will support CarPlay.

Apple was able to insert itself in between customers and car companies and make sure that its interface was the one that every iPhone user wants while driving. It’s an under-appreciated triumph for one of the world’s most successful companies. CarPlay doesn’t contribute direct Apple revenues or profits. But it ensures ongoing loyalty of iPhone users and gives Apple a pathway into the auto industry if it wants to expand.'

I am from Serbia, living in Serbia. With that in mind, I realized that my personal investments in US stocks will be liable to a 60% tax upon death (inheritance to my kids)

According to this [irs post](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns) ,  Certain deceased nonresidents who were not citizens of the United States are subject to U.S. estate taxation with respect to their U.S.-situated assets. They also list stock of corporations under us law as an example of something that would fall under us law.

Am I wrong to say that I (my kids) will be liable for a high US estate tax and talking to the IRS upon death?

With that, I have a follow up question, and that is, how do these rules apply to me buying UK stocks. Here, I have not found any posts that specifically reference non citizen, non residents. The closest to that I found was this [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/selling-or-inheriting-assets) which says that you only pay inheritance tax on land, but then also on the same page says shares could also be liable for the tax???

For me, as a very new investor (I’m only a little over a month in, so take my word with a grain of salt), “best” are the stocks that have shown consistent, steady growth and have been minimally affected by losses. At this time, my four “best” stocks are…

4) Costco (COST) - It’s had a few swings in its price, but it’s never dipped into the red. As of this post, it’s gained 6.25% in a little over a month, and it’s already paid a dividend.

3) Goldman Sachs (GS) - I’ve only held this stock for about two-three weeks, but its growth has been spectacular. In researching, I found out it was still undervalued, and man, has it shown. Even when it tumbled, it hasn’t been a nightmarish fall. 6.5% growth already.

2) AbbVie (ABBV) - I knew nothing about this company and spent three days researching it before I bought its stock, and it’s been one of the best purchased ever. It doesn’t grow as fast, but it hardly ever falls, even when the whole market is tanking. Also, its dividend is huge (4.46%). It’s grown 8.35% in almost four weeks.

1) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - First stock I ever bought. Outstanding, steady growth. Hardly has a down day. 10.8% growth in over a month. The only drawback? No dividends.",,,187,t3_ncfhmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ncfhmv/best_stocks_in_your_portfolio/,55,0.75,[1621016981.0]

Submission,noia7g,Thoughts on Pinterest?,notbrokemexican,"Pinterest is currently my biggest holding and I have a strong conviction about it. I love that it's a women-driven investment that is growing impressively fast around the world and sits at 500M monthly active users.

The leadership refers to the company as a personal media application and a search engine for ideas. Their two biggest changes has been the introduction of Shops,  which has pressured Instagram to release its own influencer version of shops and the release of Livestreams with tickets/waitrooms.

I really love the direction that this company is going in and it in some ways it kind of reminds me of the intention of YouTube. Mostly women are going on the platform with an intent to plan or search, so the need for influencing is not nearly as high as it is on platforms like Facebook or Bytedance.

In the short term, I'm bullish on Pinterest with respect to travel. I think we will see continued growth because people are planning their trips and it's a lucrative market.

In the long-term I'm bullish on it being one of the more effective forms of social media with respect to e-commerce and advertising effectiveness. A user may go on Instagram and spend more time, resulting in no net gain for an advertiser. A user on Pinterest is almost guarunteed to enter and exit with an attempted plan or shop.

Submission,nk5zl6,Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy?,PeekingPotato,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything. 

&#x200B;

Today we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple´s price is higher right now, I don´t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I´ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",Company Analysis,,101,t3_nk5zl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nk5zl6/apple_stock_analysis_is_aapl_a_good_buy/,50,0.74,[1621884208.0]

Submission,nmgr81,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 27, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 27, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. 

This week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. 

Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, “Inflation has gone from being on no one’s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.”

members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended May 22:** 406,000 vs. 425,000 expected and 444,000 the week prior
* **Continuing claims, week ended May 15:** 3.642 million vs. 3.680 million expected and a revised 3.738 the week prior

**Highlights** 

* Boeing (BA) agreed to pay at least $17 million to settle enforcement cases with the Federal Aviation Administration over production issues with its 737 jets. Stock reacted positively to the news. 
* Durable goods orders, or orders for manufactured goods intended to last at least three years, unexpectedly declined in April, ending an 11-month streak of increases, the Commerce Department said Thursday, an encouraging sign. 
* “Meme stocks” are on the move again, with AMC gapping up 40% on the day. Gamestop (GME) and AMC have both been on monster runs this week.
* Paytm, India’s largest digital payment platform, is reportedly aiming to go public later this year with a valuation of $25-$30 billion.
* Shares of Ford (F) have been on fire since the company announced it was making a big investment to manufacture EVs and recently unveiled the all-electric Ford F-150 pickup, one of the company’s most popular models. \\
* Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are all involved in a bidding process to provide cloud services to Boeing, according to multiple reports.

Submission,neqr5i,"Amazon Gains As Morgan Stanley Paints Bullish Scenario With $6,000 Target",Karnes,"'Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose in a weak market after Morgan Stanley 's (NYSE:MS) latest bullish target for the stock: $6,000 by 2023.

According to StreetInsider, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating on Amazon with a target of $4,500, while going on to make a case for the $6,000 per share mark.

The online retailer and cloud services provider currently trades at around 1.2 times 2022 earnings on a PEG basis, an approximately 30% discount to its median tech peer group.

Nowak believes that with Amazon’s scaling profitability and given its discount relative to the peer group, the stock would warrant a $4,500 level at even 1.7 times PEG, according to StreetInsider. But this may not be enough.

Factors like a large addressable market across Amazon’s business lines, including retail, advertising, logistics, healthcare, cloud, autonomous driving and the rising user base of its Prime service all combine to ask for an even higher target for the company’s stock price, the analyst believes, as per StreetInsider.

""These factors could justify a higher PEG, and a PEG of ~2-2.5X would imply a ~$5,000-$6,000 share price within the next 12 months (potentially a double from here),"" Nowak wrote.

Submission,n83cjy,WELL Health Earnings Tuesday,Ronnieisred,"Was  reading this article from the Motley and saw the company has earnings  Tuesday. After digging a little deeper I think they might blow them out  of the water.

If all is accurate this is what I found.

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish
2. They  just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led  by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of  his own money
3. Completed  the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the  company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

Submission,npaty6,The Investor's Skills and Knowledge Must-Haves,JDMKing24,"Lately, I have been browsing the new sections of a few investing subreddits, and I came to the conclusion that a lot of us are in need of education on basic concepts that don't relate solely to stocks. 

I strongly believe that everyone that owns stocks should have at least a basic understanding of the following: 

&#x200B;

\- Statistics 101 and optional Bayesian Statistics, Correlation vs Causality and Nicolas Cage

\- Macro and Microeconomics: most importantly Behavioral Economics, Biases, Preferences, Supply and Demand, Interest rates, Money supply, Monetary Policy, Market Cycles, a bit of Game Theory, Unemployment, Inflation

\- Financial Reporting / Accounting: Financial Statements and their most important elements, a bit about the IFRS and/or US GAAP frameworks

\- Financial History: Black Friday, 2008 housing crash

\- Financial Institutions: Hedge Funds, Mutual Funds, Investment Banks, Commercial Banks

\- Psychology: The Big 5 Traits of Personality, Freud's Iceberg model and the Id, Ego and Super-Ego

\- Stock Valuation: P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, CAGR, Margins and Ratios, ROE, ROA, Liquidity, EY, and their interpretations

\- Optional: Learn from the greats: Buffett, Munger, Lynch, Simons, Fisher, Graham

&#x200B;

You don't need to take any college courses for those. YouTube is your best friend for this. Fear is the product of not knowing what to expect and the respective odds.

Submission,nb2j3d,Tesla has a change in payment methods,InanetV,"Elon has just stated they will no longer allow a certain coin for payment.

https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?s=21

This is a big change due to Elon's influence in that sector and TSLA's profitability with that coin. 

I am wondering if going forward we will see it completely gone for their balance sheet. 

In my opinion, it is hard to tell whether or not he was forced to say that, as the board has had past issues with Elon in the past. Either way, going forward this might change the public perception of Elon or Tesla, which will mostly likely have direct effect on the share price. 

I wanted to add I have no position in TSLA and wanted to provide an update. 

I thought this was especially interesting because that sector used Elon as excuse for a catalyst when TSLA invested into that coin. This obviously helped his public image as well. 

The fact that he also stated he's looking at other currencies is letting another crowd to think there may be a chance. I don't think the board would let him accept payment in that currency.

What do you think all will happen going forward?",,,116,t3_nb2j3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nb2j3d/tesla_has_a_change_in_payment_methods/,44,0.8,[1620861938.0]

Submission,nqxp6i,The Weekly DD - Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Rise of The Gamers,TheStonksHub,"The video game industry has taken off since the pandemic and is expected to reach a value of \~**$290 billion by 2026**. How does this compare to the global box office industry? From 2019 to 2020 we saw revenues shift in the following:

**2019 -> 2020**

*Global Box Office*

\~42 billion (all-time-record) -> \~11.5 billion

*Gaming Industry*

\~152 billion -> \~164 billion

That’s right, in 2019 (pre-pandemic) the gaming industry was already over 3.5x the size of the box office entertainment industry and over 14x in 2020\*. Gaming’s 2020 growth outperformed the growth of both movies and sports combined.

&#x200B;

There is a shift in the ecosystem from gaming for fun to becoming more of a social event, ie: hanging with friends *while* playing video games for the hobbyist gamer, and streaming for the professionals. Gaming, once thought to be an activity for the young, has proliferated through all age groups and demographics. In 2020, 64% of all American adults (214.4 million people) played video games.

&#x200B;

Check out evolution of streaming platforms since the Pandemic. Out of the top 3 competitors (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook) Twitch was the clear winner here with users streaming and revenues jumping significantly. This massive expansion of total addressable market (TAM) is most likely a one time occurence, but the gaming industry is still expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 11% moving forward.

**eSports**

Another beneficiary of the gaming industry boom, which is not talked about enough nor well-understood by many, are eSports. Essentially, eSports are gaming competitions that offer cash as prizes and draw YUGE crowds. The eSports industry alone is set to surpass \~1.1 billion in revenues in 2021, a 14% growth from 2020’s \~950 million. To put things in perspective some of the top eSports events compete with the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf tournaments where the winner takes home *millions* of dollars.

**Enters Corsair Gaming (CRSR)**

What is Corsair Gaming (CRSR)? They are a designer and manufacturer of high-end gear for all things PC gaming. They offer four different segments of products, almost all of which have 5-star ratings on Amazon.

&#x200B;

1. PC peripherals: keyboards, headsets, mice, mousepads, chais, etc.
2. Streaming equipment: green screens, capture cards, microphones.
3. PC components: almost anything outside the graphics card that can be found inside the PC tower (the big metal box that the computer is made of).
4. Gaming PCs for those that don’t want to self-customize their own.

**Corsair - Outlook**

With the rise of gaming comes new opportunity for CRSR to expand its sales. In 2021, the PC gaming market was estimated to be $45.5B with \~50% of all gamers using a PC to play video games. This creates a very opportune market for those who can provide value to the PC gamer.

The target market who purchases peripherals are a passionate, well-researched group with access to many other brands. Therefore, only a well-liked (and popular) brand can succeed in this market. Thus, the market advantages large incumbents over smaller up-and-comers. Their brand value is also obvious in the premiums that their brand allows them to charge. Their gaming components and systems products, which they are currently the market leader, demands an average of \~40% premiums compared to their competitors! This means their products cost 40% more, on average, than their competitors and they are still out-selling them.

**Final Thoughts**

Given the rapid growth of the gaming industry boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, CRSR is on track to capture a large segment of this growth and expand its business as a result. However, CRSR is not expected to have any massive shifts in its business nor do their growth strategies include any drastic changes to their current strategy. Corsair is a premium brand with solid market penetration. Although they may not experience the same explosive from 2019 to 2020, they are in a great position to remain a market leader in a fast-growing industry.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change    the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,    those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

May Q1 Earnings Quote:

As    you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of     $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a     record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded     share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward  shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share  buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

Then in answering a question from an analyst

Doug   Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you   mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about   kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?   And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal   teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy   and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the   float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we    have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm     going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:    UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to    shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a    buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they    can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that  it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage. At current    stock price levels the CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Submission,n7mz6p,LMND - an over valued insurance stock pretending to be a tech stock?,radarbot,"I got caught up in LMND during the January hype and I now I'm a bag holder. It's made me look at LMND in more detail and really dissect their financials. Below is a short DD on LMND looking at their 10K annual report in preparation for their Q1 report coming out on Monday.

https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001691421/7d400e55-689a-4fc1-9a55-28ce9601dc6e.pdf

To begin, LMND is an insurance provider that is looking to disrupt the insurance marketplace using AI to handle claims and drive high customer support.

LMND is currently trading at MktCap of 5B with a P/S multiple of 52. Compared to other incumbents in the pure insurance industry:

ALL: P/S - 0.89, MC - 40B

PGR: P/S - 1.39, MC - 62B

TRV: P/S - 1.26, MC - 40B

So obviously LMND is trading at a multiple that treats it more like a tech company than an insurance company. But lots of companies want to be valued at a multiple of a tech company vs insurance company, so lets dig deeper.

LMND made 94BM in revenue in 2020 with a YoY growth of 40%. In their earnings call in March, they stated that they expect greater growth slowdown in 2021...so there's definitely reason to be cautious here given that their mkt cap multiplier is totally based on growth projections.

Here's the troubling part of LMND. Even though their revenue is growing aggressively, their net losses are stacking up too. In 2019 they had net loss of 108M on 67M of revenue, and in 2020 they had net loss of 120M in 94M of revenue. So though their net losses aren't growing at the same rate as their revenue, they're definitely not closing the gap at a great rate. The biggest contribution to their net losses is G&A and technology development. G&A can't be helped as I assume they went on a hiring blitz in 2020. But their investment in ""technology development"" increased 98% from 9.8B to 19.4B. 

While G&A is straight forward as employee compensation, Technology Development is listed as follows:

Technology development - Technology development consists of employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and benefits, and expenses related to vendors engaged in product management, design, development and testing of the Company's websites and products. Technology development also includes allocated occupancy costs and related overhead based on headcount.

Pretty abstract stuff...

Okay, so lets make some projections. The simplest projections is that we're seeing a big shift in the tech market place as a bear market has taken hold the past 3 months. May doesn't look any better, but many of these high flying ""tech stocks"" are now seeing a reduction in multiple. Even if LMND could grow their revenue by 200% this year, if the market starts valuing them like an insurance company and not a tech company (a la RKT), we'll see LMND's price tank into the mid 20's and maybe even lower.

The second projection is if we look at growth of revenue. In their Q4, Lemonade said they are seeing slowdown in a key growth metric:

https://news.futunn.com/en/post/8971338?level=1&data_ticket=1620471675650956

The stock tanked to $113 from $132, and has been on a slide since then, influenced by general tech stock malaise. Even at its current price of $79 it seems over valued in some regards.

Here are the key metrics to look for. LMND is projecting revenue in Q1 to be 22M. That would set it on base to make about $100M in CY2021. Which isn't spectacular growth to justify its valuation, as it slows the growth rate down to 10% YoY.

Overall, LMND stock looks really dicey at the moment. Given this information, I'm probably going to unload half my bags before earnings and see what the news is. If the news is good, then I'll hold the other half and hope to reduce my losses. Otherwise, I plan to immediately unload the remaining half if the growth numbers look bad since this will ensure another 3 month slide in price. If growth numbers are bad, expect LMND to fall below their IPO price.

LMND did an offering at $165/share in January. I feel real bad for anyone who has their cost average that high, because looking at their financial statements and projections, LMND doesn't look like they'll get back up there in 2021.



Last note, I think LMND is aiming for an AI holy grail to do their real disruption. They're hoping that if they can handle all claims using AI (of which, currently AI Jim, their claims AI, handles 95% of all claims), they may be able to drive down their costs of doing business so aggressively that their margins become industry leading. Company's like ALL, TRV and PGR have demonstrated that they are too large and bureaucratic to offer solutions like this. So right now, this is the only saving grace of LMND imho.

Submission,n78n3g,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 7, 2021",psychotrader00,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 7, 2021**

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a “string” of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “The smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn’t have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today’s number certainly won’t be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

**Highlights**

* The weak April jobs report catalyzed a rebound in technology names Friday morning, with the disappointing data easing fears that the Federal Reserve will adjust their policies in the near-term.

Submission,ngltn9,"This might help some of you who question market fairness, or why a company might drop in stock price after excellent earnings.",7LyLa,"The reason you are frustrated / don't understand the results of market action is because of the time you entered the market likely. Millions of young new investors entered the market during the COVID shutdown.

This led to rates being extremely low due to the pandemic, stimulus (cash) available to more people than ever, and massive equity investments and buybacks. The end result is much of the stock market being now (overvalued) in profit taking range for major institutions. (who have a much larger impact on the stock market than retail investors) Nothing will make sense right now, and even in the near future, in fact it may very well get even more risky and volatile because rates being low and inflation are serious concerns.

Rates can't possible stay low forever and will climb at some point. Ask any experienced trader what happens when rates go up in the market... typically you see heavy selling action and an alternative switch of money from stocks to bonds/gold/or etc. Right now, you can have a FANG stock for example that can crush earnings and it doesn't mean they are fair game for a institution to not dump.

Why? because context is everything in this market, pull up a chart of major FANG's and see their progress the past year and a half, it's been quite the massive runup. That rollercoaster up, can, will and has effected the outcome of earnings in the present. The market is not just valued in the present by those who have the liquidity to move it, they value things in a more broad spectrum. 

Rates, Valuation of stock price, run up levels of the stock, future performance is relative to all of this to them. Just remember they hit the buy button when the stock was trading at an undervalued level, and hit the sell button at the top. They master this game, they have high speed computers, algorithms, its down to a science. You will NEVER be able to compete with them, but you CAN buy when they do at the low if you do your due diligence.

Submission,ncfd6l,Is Square insanely overvalued?,sven2123,"Ive had a position in Square since $150 and obviously is has done well for me. But as I have been learning more about valuating companies, and not just chasing growth, ive gotten a bit confused. All over the internet I see people praising the stock and banks consistently raising their price targets. Currently SQ has a PE ratio of about 250. Net income is expected to grow around 45% a year. Lets say net income consistently increases by 50% each year and the price stays flat at $200. Then it would still take 7 whole years for it to reach a reasonable PE below 20.

&#x200B;

Now I know PE isnt everything, and the market can be irrational. But how is it even possible that this company is valued this high, and according to analysts price targets it still has at least 50% upside? Am I missing something here or is its valuation only kept this high with irrational hope?

Just adding a few other ratios that make it seem overvalued to me:

PEG: 5+

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Submission,nkbmpp,Virgin Galactic II.,DontWantUrSoch,"Initially, I wanted to come into this post completely unbiased, I wanted to present the bull and bear case and give you a complete overview of sentiment and questioning from both camps, but I couldn’t help myself. Let me say it out loud, SPCE has an argument to make, I’m here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult. No company or stock out there is a guarantee, I am not here to sell SPCE, it is still high risk as before, but that’s the nature of space exploration isn’t it…

Critique #1 - Revenue:  The company has millions in cash, enough to continue burning for 2 years. They plan to generate income via paying customers, astronaut training, low orbit cargo/experiment carry assignments, transportation offerings, sponsorship, and more. If this company doesn’t see future earning possible, why would they move forward to build more ships? Why would they hire more staff? Why would there be 3+ other companies wanting to eat into their market share?? 

Critique #2 - The Competition: “SpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market, leaving SPCE with zero-to-little gains.”

 \#Debunked:  Let’s start with the elephant in the room, SpaceX, Elon Musk has presented concepts for SN high-speed point to point travel, getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours, that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch. 1. Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship? Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off? This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city, you would have to travel to a remote place to get on the supposed fast flight… 2 Boarding this “fast flight” requires a suit up, when you get into space launch, you must train to do this, you must wear an astronaut suit, the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years, it’s not going to happen, flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time convenience...not in a rocket at least. #3 What is the main objective of SpaceX? Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism, SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems, they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander, they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches, and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars, there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism. Now let’s talk about Blue Origin, this is VGs biggest rival as of today, but BO is clearing behind SPCE. BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multi-planetary via space hotels, this vision has faded off as of late. BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX, the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could not meet its original goals, it’s now pivoting out of necessity, a company mission statement is important, and BO is confused and lost. The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing, their ergonomics, standard up and down flight experience, the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE. They don’t have an airport to take off from…I could go on all day. VG is founded by Richard Branson, a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality, entertainment, and travel markets, BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever, if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest, VG is a no brainer. VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney, BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systems….are you noticing a pattern?….

Critique #3 - Death:  I’ve read the comments “this is a disaster waiting to happen”, “they will get canceled when thy kill somebody”….for the record, this is a great critique and justified concern, death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback. To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries. Let me ask you, has anyone died on a plane, in a car crash, a motorcycle, perhaps skydiving?...certainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash VG will have legal corners covered.

.....

I do not have a crystal ball, I do not offer financial advice. I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over, anyone out there who is taking interest, now you know, SPCE is real. This company is a retail favorite, love it or hate it, we are all unable to look away… in an era of pent-up travel demand, the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE, whatever your take, wish them luck.

.....

NOTE: The wealthy pay 50,000+ to scale Mount Everest every year, (Everest is cold, physically demanding, and utterly dangerous) why would they not regularly pay for SPCE?

NOTE: The cost to fly to space was over a million just years ago, VG can fly you up for 250k.",,,57,t3_nkbmpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nkbmpp/virgin_galactic_ii/,32,0.79,[1621899486.0]

Submission,nb2jl5,I Didn't Look at My Portfolio Today,TrioxinTwoFortyFive,"I did not look at my portfolio today and do not have the inclination to look for a while.  I got stopped out of my speculative plays during the first two months of the year then moved to more conservative stocks and ETFs.  I am pretty confident in my current positions.  Some positions will go red.  Maybe they all will.  But over the long run quality wins out.  I have cash to buy if I find something selling for a large discount.

I think there is a pretty good chance we will see a market slump that lasts into summer.  People will likely freak out about inflation.  The experts can explain inflation is transient, brought on by supply chain problems, labor shortages from people unwilling to work, whatever, but people will believe their own anecdotal experiences combined with an unease with the consequences of politicians giving out free money to anyone with a pulse.  I just got off the phone with my parents.  They just returned from a grocery run to ""stock up before prices increase.""   It looks like toilet paper hoarding all over again, and this will cause further prices increases that are already being driven by supply shortages.  That sort of pessimism is not good for the market.

On the plus side there is a really good chance we will see some great buying opportunities.  Buy the dip does not mean buy when the market goes down 2% for the day; it means buy when the stock significantly declines, usually over a course of weeks or months.  Some of the growth stocks that were trading at obscene valuations may become attractive.

Submission,n8wtpm,Inflation Coming?,Useful-Stayooo,"Hey guys. I'm so worried about this. Most countries around the globe, particularly the U.S. are going to reopen soon. People will then have to spend most of the money they got from stimulus check/social support they got from the government, which would drive up the demand for goods and services. This increase in demand would also increase the prices of goods.  I was wondering how do you guys prepare for inflation. Should I liquidate all my stocks at a loss and then buy assets that protect against inflation? Or should I just hold them for the long term like I was supposed to do?

Share thoughts, PROS, CONS?",UltimateTraders,"If you do not follow the mortgage sector, RKT is the market leader and reported earnings just 2 weeks ago. Their report was a miss by a penny but still made close to 2 billion dollars as a company. When RKT missed the entire sector dropped drastically. The main stocks that crashed were LDI, HMPT and UWMC. I strongly believe RKT was the culprit. Famous for being short as high as 35% just a quarter ago. I believe the sharks were still nearby and ready. The short % has not been updated since earnings and is at 7%. I believe the new short is once again at 20% or above. The very next day following earnings the rest of the sector has been attacked. The difference with these companies and most stocks, especially tech/growth is they all make serious, serious money!

**LDI makes close to 1 billion a year, just made over 300 million. Announced a special dividend of 200 million or 62 cents a share. They announced a regular dividend per share. The market cap is slightly over 4 billion. Yes, they have a PE ratio of under 4! Cash flows to buy back shares instead of using money for dividends. They have lost over 1.2 billion in market cap since RKT report.**

**HMPT just made 149 million the past 3 months. They have lost over 500 million in market cap since RKT reported. They have not announced a dividend or anything yet. The company trades at 2.5x earnings. They make cash!**

**UWMC, did the right thing makes cash and announced a 300 million buyback. I believe they have smoked out the shorts as it dipped as low as 6.25 and has recovered nicely.**

**RKT makes roughly 8 billion a year! They are valued near 35 billion and have lost over 14 billion since earninings! They last quarter gave out over 2 billion for free via a special dividend of over 1.14 per share. They have 2 billion shares! They make over $4 per share and trade under 17!!!**

LDI trades 200,000 shares daily! The stock is under 14!! Can you imagine a 100 million buyback?? They are giving 100 million via dividend and just gave 200 million special dividend they can do it!

HMPT trades just over 100,000 shares at about 6! Even a 20 million buyback will moon the stock. They just made 149 million the last 3 months!

Submission,nc8xtf,Helpful Sources for Understanding the Lumber Industry and the Value of Lumber Companies,Ding123456,"Based on questions I've been getting the last couple weeks, I want to share all the various sources I’ve used to keep myself educated on the industry and get my “feel” for long term exit strategies.

This post isn’t about doing EPS or IV projections.  It’s simply about how you can keep doing ongoing research about the general direction and prices of lumber the commodity, as well as any major news/opinions out there that could affect the commodity’s future direction.  

I find it **very** helpful, because on weeks like this one where everyone lost their fucking minds because the price of used cars went up a bit, I held strong because in the end I knew the CPI report and the panic selling that followed didn’t change the market fundamentals driving the lumber industry’s record profits.  I didn’t panic when futures went red the last few days, because I know how well these companies will do even if lumber prices drops another 30% and I knew that the cash markets were doing just fine.  So this “market feel” research helps you have confidence in your investment so you can ignore the daily noise.

**Basic Links for understanding the Current State of Lumber Industry**

I think it will be helpful for people to know exactly why lumber is surging and the market dynamics that caused it, because you can then use that to make educated guesses at whether your various companies still have long term value and have confidence in your investment when the fundamentals are still there.

Here are two excellent podcasts from two industry insiders discussing the current state of the industry:

[Odd Lots Podcast with Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-the-price-of-lumber-has-soared-day-after-day-after-day/id1056200096?i=1000518629853)

[Building Optimal Podcast with Dustin Jalbert; Fastmarkets RISI Senior Economist; Episode #71]( https://buildingoptimal.com/episodes/)

Both are great podcasts to help you understand what’s causing the surge from the people that know.  Hint: it’s not due to an industry-wide conspiracy.  This will help you start to figure out whether you should stick with your investment when lumber dips from it’s high after the summer.


**Apparently Social Media Actually has a Positive Use**

I don’t use social media, but I got a twitter account for work related reconnaissance and then found out that a handful of extremely knowledge people in the lumber industry are tweeting at each other non-stop about things going on in the cash markets / futures, as well as the occasional opinions.  These people often post articles on the area or new podcasts.  So it’s a great way to keep yourself educated.  Also, they are just good people and it can be entertaining to see what’s going on with them any particular day.

It can be insightful (and calming on red days), especially since normal members of the public can’t see what’s happening in the cash markets real time, but sometimes these guys will let you know.  The other day, when all the futures were nose diving, cash markets were still up, meaning the immediate price of lumber was doing just fine and it the red was really from the speculators jumping ship (which is a good thing!).

[Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://twitter.com/LumberTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – The King of Lumber Twitter.  Nice guy and great insights.  Don’t ask him what the price of lumber will be in Q4.  No one fucking knows.  

[RISI Senior Economist Dustin Jalbert](https://twitter.com/2x4caster) – Also a very prolific poster in Lumber Twitter and will share great insights.

[Forestry Insider Bryan Davis](https://twitter.com/bryandav1z) – Another knowledgeable insider who likes to share insights on the industry and some of the main lumber stocks.

[Housing expert/Chief Economist Ali Wolf](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon) – The housing market is driving this surge.  The lumber industry uses housing demand/data as the canary in the coal mind.  You probably should too.  If housing demand is still going bananas, then lumber will do so as well.

[Madison’s Lumber Prices](https://twitter.com/LumberNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – They post Lumber Cash Prices, typically about 2 weeks behind, but that’s still way ahead of whenever the company’s next earnings statements, and provides a break down by the major types of lumber.  Sometimes you even get a video interview/update.

[RISI Analyst Bryan Smith](https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en) – He tweets out when some of these forestry companies declare wood pulp price increases (which extra is a significant source of income for a lot of these companies).  I find it a helpful data point.

Those are main ones.  But if you follow these people enough, you will see them talking to other insightful people as well and sharing informative content.

**Publicly Open Websites That Help You get a Sense of Market Direction**

Here’s the link for lumber futures: [CME Lumber Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#) - This is the closest thing to a general market gauge of the lumber industry.  But this isn’t an exact predictor and this price is pegged to the Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&Btr.  There are many different types of dimensional lumber, some cost more (like Eastern SPF) and some cost less (like Southern Yellow Pine – SYP).  But this can help you get a sense what the future outlook may look like generally.  But remember, these prices can change.  They can go up or down, these aren’t guarantees of the future price of lumber.  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesn’t mean it will stay that way.

[Nasdaq Lumber futures Graph](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) – a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration.  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically.  Why is this important?  Because you can look at the 2018 levels, see how well these companies did then.  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak, then you really don’t need to panic.  

The industry’s breakeven price is generally around $400 mfbm.  2018 hit $600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them.  So maybe you don’t need to panic sell when the futures dip below **$1200** from their $1600/1700 peak.  What matters is where it settles.  Also, you can see that in 2020, the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazy.

[Madison’s Lumber Reports]( https://madisonsreport.com/) If you hate twitter, here’s another way to look at cash prices for the main types of lumber.  Again, the free stuff is typically about 1.5-2 weeks old.

[US Housing Data Releases](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf) – US Census release new data typically the third week of every month, posting the data from the prior month.  This is a HUGE stat in the lumber industry.  It helps you see what home construction rates will look like now and in the coming months (due to housing permit numbers which precede starts by 2-3 months).  When the number drops month after month, don’t panic. Make sure you consider other sources for context.  But a large drop over time, that’s when you know the party is over.

[Shanghai Pulp futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices) – This isn’t lumber.  But most of the lumber companies also produce wood pulp and it makes up a large part of their income when doing well.  This is the closest thing to a price indicator for the general wood pulp market.  There are many different types of wood pulps, of varying price, but this is turning into a decent gauge of the general direction of the wood pulp market.  [Here’s a recent publication praising it and giving you more info on the current pulp market.](https://www.fastmarkets.com/Media/Files/PRA/FMV2/pdfs/Promotional%20materials/The_future_of_China_pulp_futures.pdf)

**Non-Lumber Specific Tools**

[Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) is a website that lets you look up the insider buying/selling of any stock.  

[Whale wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/) is another excellent website that lets you look and see which hedge funds own the stock your looking at.  Lets you know are they buying or selling en masse, calls or puts.  It gets their data from 13-F’s so it isn’t real time but it is a helpful data point nonetheless.

Overall, there is a lot of publicly available information that you can use to inform yourself on how the industry is going and if the immediate future is looking good or bad.  It may be a good idea to look at prior earnings presentations in whatever company your invested during the periods lumber was up, and see how they did at those prices.  That will help you gauge whether these companies will still do great even when lumber prices drop below $1K, because at some point they will.  Monetary policy/QE is not causing this.

If there is one place you *shouldn’t* go for insights on lumber stocks/industry, it’s Motley Fool / CNBC or frankly any of the tops results from google.  That free content is dogshit.  You can look at my post history to see how horribly off the mark these free websites are in recommending “lumber stocks.”  You are not the customer in their eyes, you are the product.  Keep that in mind.

**TLDR:** there is a lot of simple, free stuff out there to help you evaluate your investments or whether you should invest in lumber companies.  I am not a financial analyst or an industry insider.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.  Don’t panic sell because some internet dipshits who know nothing of this industry are calling the peak (but not backing that talk up with puts).  Don’t FOMO buy just because “the sucker’s going up.”

**Disclosure:** most of the stock I hold is in RFP, but I also hold some WFG and LPX.  Anyone have thoughts on what they like more LPX vs WFG long term (the next 6-18 months), please share and why.  I can’t decide which I want to buy more of.

I won’t need the money for 20-30+ years, and I’m comfortable holding through volatility. My focus is really just finding quality companies that will be long-term winners. My question is:

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings. 

2. I’ve been aggressively buying stocks on the way down and trimming positions on the way up. How often should I be taking profit? Does this strategy make sense long-term?

Submission,njte4e,Lilium to establish airline operations in Europe,TaxShield,"Lilium announces that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

### Media Release

**Munich, May 20, 2021:** Lilium GmbH (“Lilium”), positioned to be a global leader in regional electric air mobility with the development of its electric vertical take-off and landing jet (“Lilium Jet”), and Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group, one of the largest business aircraft and helicopter operators worldwide, today announced that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

Lilium’s vision for a flexible transportation ecosystem is supported by world-class partners. Luxaviation Group brings over 60 years of experience operating passenger service with hundreds of aircraft under management and 10 Air Operator Certificates (“AOCs”) across Europe.

Building on Luxaviation Group's track record, which includes securing the first European Union Aviation Safety Agency AOC approval for a business jet operator, the parties anticipate Luxaviation Group will become responsible for parts of the airline operations being developed by Lilium. This includes securing necessary approvals and managing pilots, which will be trained following a type rating concept developed by Lufthansa Aviation Training, another Lilium partner. As Lilium continues developing its launch networks in Europe for the planned commercial launch in 2024, Luxaviation Group will also work with Lilium on the development of its best-in-class customer experience, built around Lilium’s digital airline platform and the 7-Seater Lilium Jet.

“We are proud to be working alongside Luxaviation Group, a leading operator in the aviation sector with a track record in offering an innovative and customer-focused service, to build out the Lilium network in Europe. This marks a key milestone as we prepare for launch, and we look forward to working together to provide an exceptional airline service for our passengers,” explains Remo Gerber, Chief Operating Officer at Lilium.

Patrick Hansen, Group CEO at Luxaviation Group said: “Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft will fundamentally change the way we travel, and the Lilium network is poised to be at the forefront of this sea change in aviation”. Christophe Lapierre, Head of Strategy of Luxaviation Group adds: “We are very pleased to have been selected by Lilium to be their partner in aircraft operations. As an early believer in advanced air mobility, we look forward to bringing our experience and credentials to the partnership with Lilium and building out a service that will truly feel like a first of its kind.”

Lilium has previously announced plans for launch networks in Germany through partnerships with Munich, Nuremberg, Dusseldorf, and Cologne/Bonn airports.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index   fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately  determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The more money that flows into index funds, however, [may worsen the results of index funds](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * This is a simplification as there are costs between the spreads, but you either pay management fees or the spread costs. You no longer have to have commissions on top.
* During times of volatility, companies that have poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)   even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
      * This may not be totally accurate as the manager may be doing some of this, but you don't have the choice of when he sells, only when you do.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don’t want to support.
   * Due   to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the   index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that’s because it is.
      * Funds can attempt to counter this with some complex financial tools, but that doesn't mean they are successful.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market effectively. Tons of us seem to be able to buy at the peak no problem.
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies   with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a   sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies   missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech   seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this necessarily as a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite   compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being   found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the best companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well   diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the   S&P 500.

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This   seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other   that aren’t really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I   ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.  Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less  than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will  likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical  issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were  also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they  could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750   stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks  were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the   industry index. For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4   years was compared to this index value with the following type of   breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For   example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was   10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,   they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The   relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there   was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth   only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be   decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This   left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the   company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently   in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them   being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?   Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude   them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These   26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and   September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these  stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total   purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The   chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested   dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For   those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date, including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850   tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.   The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin – shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin – shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin – shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin – shows a companies’ operating profitability
* ROE – shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA – shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC – shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio – shows the financial stability of a company

More   metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were  then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to   determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to   median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of   the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3   stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over   the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each   stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I   also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the  metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this  ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a  score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9  categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a  company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could  do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t  match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or  the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the  analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company’s most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I   applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at   the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock   that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a   high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,   I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their   financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off   their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly   leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that   Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns   Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great   synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of   this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested in reviewing,   such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil   and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated   \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d need to build a   separate model.

I then looked at   each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are   all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit   margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,   etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We   were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better   understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was   not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83 companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

* I   partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021. Took a long time to write all of this up.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly   5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the   2020 experiment made it to this year’s list. 15 out of 26 of last year’s   final picks also made it. I’ll post an update once I have more than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I’ll do my best to answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.
* It would  be great to be able to run some more thorough regression analysis, but since the math portion only narrows the playing field and a fair amount of the heavy lifting still occurs with individual analysis, this would be pretty much impossible. Creating a model based off past results may also provide a bias that I'm not sure I'd be immune to either.
* The math is used to find stocks worth reviewing, provide the visualizations to perform comparisons between stocks in the industry and across the full data set to assist with the human analysis.
* I've seen a fair number of posts along the lines of ""How do you find your stocks, how do I find stocks to research, etc."" Here are a list of \~100 stocks in a variety of industries you can review if interested. Some you've heard of, some you probably have not.
* The 2021 stock list makes up 28% of the S&P, with the 59 stocks that are in both lists, due to the market cap ranking.

\*I   am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to  ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results  and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don’t   understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and   henceforth.

Submission,n83a2v,"Paying zero taxes on Long Term capital gains, has anybody actually done this?",Anth916,"I was reading about Long Term capital gains, and supposedly there's 3 options for how much tax you're going to pay. 0 percent, 15 percent and 20 percent. Supposedly, if your yearly income is 40K or less, you pay **ZERO** percent. From $40,001 to $441,450 is 15 percent (most apes). $441,451 and above is 20 percent.

My question is this... Let's say that I bought 100 shares of AMZN for $1700 per share on March 16, 2020 (170k total investment).

Then I sold those 100 shares of AMZN this last April 30th for $3500 per share. My profit would be 180k. If my job in 2020 only paid me 39k in 2020, and I had no other source of income, I'd pay **ZERO** taxes on that 180k profit? Seems way too freaking good to be true.

Excerpt:

> But VW isn't about to let a crisis go to waste. Instead of letting dust collect on the plant's machinery and many workers being sent home, upgrades will take place on the assembly line focusing on quality improvements and other related areas.

> In addition, workers will continue training and preparation to build the ID.4 all-electric crossover.

Submission,nin6f2,"Thoughts on China, their economy and major stocks from their people follow (BABA)",LegendLarrynumero1,"As you may know, BABA has been fallen 30% since it's high in October.  But their financial are just too good.  I spoke with several Chinese people yesterday who are living and working in China.  I wanted to get a feel for what the situation is on the ground, how they see the economy, future and thoughts on BABA/Jack Ma.


BABA Has 5 Operating Segments


China Commerce (65%): Segment revenues are derived from retail e-commerce and associated marketing services in China.


China Wholesale & Other (12%): Segment revenues are derived from wholesale commerce and logistics services, primarily driven by Chinese consumption.


Cloud Computing (8%): Segment revenues are derived based on customers' duration and usage of Alibaba's service.

International Commerce (8%): Segment revenues are derived from retail and wholesale operations as well as from advertising services outside China.


Digital Media & Innovation Initiatives (7%): Segment revenues are derived from content subscription, software subscription and merchant advertising offerings.

Alibaba (BABA) is one of the largest companies in China.  It's hard to truly understand everything they do, as they are involved in just about everything.  When Chinese pay for something, they don't use credit cards.  They use either WeChat/WeiXin (Tencent) or they use Alipay (BABA).  Nearly every Chinese person has these 2 apps on their phone.  It is essential.

----------
View from China

In speaking to Chinese people, as I have done for years, you have to understand everything is always going to be optimistic. From TV news to social media ""influencers"", the government is always sending messages to the people about how great...everything is and how not to trust outsiders.  So at first everyone was overly optimistic and diffused any thoughts I had of negative impressions.  This was to be expected.  As you dig further traces of truth open up.

First, China has done a decent job of getting the virus under control...but it's not as far a the US.  The population is so large it is going to take a full year from today to get 70% vaccinated.

These vaccines are less effective than what the US has.  They are in Phase III trials of their own mRNA vaccine which should be better.

Tourism won't come back this year as China is requiring everyone to have taken the Chinese vaccine to enter china as the moment.  

There is general optimism but I would call it cautious optimism.  The economy seems to be holding well, virus seems to be holding well...but many fear this could fall apart if something goes wrong.  

BABA

When asked about BABA and Jack Ma everyone heard about the fine paid by the company.  The said China is trying to crack down on monopolies and thus considered Alibaba as such.  All remain positive about Alibaba and Jack Ma but understood the government wants to protect the people.

What they think will happen?

Many felt Alibaba will continue to do well, but due to China's warning to them about Monopoly, they feel Alibaba will slow it's pace of growth.  Either intentional or mandated, this wasn't sure.  Alibaba can not continue on the same path forever.  It will not be allowed.  The fine was a warning to them.  Next step would be much drastic (prison for executives, company take over).  

---

Conclusion

Chinese are optimistic on their economy and Alibaba but with caution.  

I better understand the drop in BABA now.  It's not about how great they were in the past, but the fear of what will happen if they continue this way...and realistically they can not continue.  
A few speculated that the company will now be more controlled by the government but this is speculation.

This was the end of FY 2021 for the company. Revenue was reported at $3.3b with FY 2022 projections also be over $3b. 

TTWO has long been my favorite video game developer and is an exceptionally well run company. They have no debt and very healthy cash flow. The only downside to $TTWO compared to competitors like $ATVI and $EA is the lack of recurring revenue. $ATVI and $EA both have best-selling franchises like ""Call of Duty* and *Madden* that are refreshed every year.

## What is Oatly?

Oatly is a Swedish vegan milk maker, producing a sustainable alternative to dairy products using oats. It was formed in the 1990s following research from Lund University, which led Oatly to patent its enzyme technology that turns oats into a milk substitute.

## When is the Oatly IPO?

Oatly’s [IPO](https://www.forex.com/en/market-analysis/latest-research/what-is-an-ipo/) is expected to take place on Thursday 20 May 2021, listing its shares under 'OTLY' on Nasdaq. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse are the underwriters.

The company Oatly announced on Tuesday 23 February that it had submitted a confidential filing for an IPO with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering is expected to take place following the SEC’s review, depending on market conditions.

Oatly’s IPO would raise money to fund growth, as well as a chance for existing investors to cash in on their holdings.

Submission,ni77cc,"Staying away from those EV startups that are targeting Hydrogen Fuel Cell plays, or Fool Cells (incl. Nikola and Advent Technologies)",Torlek1,"This week is the time for pivoting away from those EV startups that are targeting hydrogen fuel cell plays, or Fool Cells.

This week, the next Papa of EV World, Herbert Diess, referenced this bit of news from earlier this month:

[Hydrogen instead of electrification? Potentials and risks for climate targets](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/hydrogen-instead-of-electrification-potentials-and-risks-for-climate-targets)

The CEO of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, stated that hydrogen fuel cell technology won't be feasible for cars for at least a decade:

[VW CEO Says Electric Batteries Are Better than Hydrogen Cars](https://interestingengineering.com/vw-ceo-says-electric-batteries-are-better-than-hydrogen-cars)

> The German newspaper Handelsblatt was the first to report on the PIK's research, which in turn sparked Diess's Twitter post, stating (in German) ""Such fuels as a universal climate solution are a bit of a false promise. While they are wonderfully versatile, they cannot be expected to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. This can only be achieved with direct electrification. Hydrogen-based fuels are likely to be very scarce and uncompetitive for at least another decade.""

And just yesterday, the original Papa of EV World, Elon Musk, agreed.

> Diess's Twitter post was supported by Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who also takes a firm stance on electric batteries as the method to power EVs. Musk wrote on Twitter that ""Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use.""

Submission,n98phf,"I used text mining to track and compare stock predictions in r/stocks, pennystocks, and WallStreetBets over two years. Here are the results:",FTV_baelor,"**tl;dr:** **After the events in January, a team of researchers from USF looked at lots of stock predictions from** [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) **and concluded that they tend to perform very well. However, predictions on** [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) **performed slightly better, and** [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) **blew them both out of the water. Scroll down to “results” for details, or read “word choice” for some funny auxiliary results. Slightly longer tl;dr at the bottom.**

A few weeks ago, Business Insider posted [this](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wall-street-bets-reddit-traders-more-skilled-responsible-academic-study-2021-4-1030291276) article, reviewing [a research paper](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=710087064097089109073116009067086122015017095012001064108080023002087014024122090093101099062003019016045100086115111100005029007087059020059072074070018006118068031021076024031087127076020075109119113072095069023096097001091085000025010076027126000&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) from a team of researchers from USF (Daniel Bradley, Jan Hanousek, Russell Jame, and Zicheng Xiao). In the wake of the GameStop/Melvin/Robinhood clusterfuck and subsequent congressional hearing in January, these researchers manually read through a huge number of DD posts on [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) and tracked the results of these predictions. They concluded that predictions on this subreddit perform very well, on average. In the debate about whether reddit posts mislead retail investors, it certainly seems like they do not.

The article does a decent job of concisely summarizing the researchers’ papers, but the fine folks over on [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/)… didn’t really get the point of the article. Maybe they skimmed it. Maybe they can’t read. I don’t know. Either way, when the article was posted on that subreddit, it was treated with derision (never change, WSB).

(As a side note, whenever you come across an article on a popular publication that reviews a scientific research paper, you should try to find and read the actual paper. Often, the summary misinterprets the results of the paper, and even if not, they definitely leave out some really important or interesting results. In this case, the [actual paper](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=710087064097089109073116009067086122015017095012001064108080023002087014024122090093101099062003019016045100086115111100005029007087059020059072074070018006118068031021076024031087127076020075109119113072095069023096097001091085000025010076027126000&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE) contains a huge depth of interesting auxiliary results and conversations, almost none of which are covered in the Business Insider article, and I won’t cover even half of them in this write-up.)

This article came out about two weeks before I was wrapping up a text mining project that was asking the exact same questions. What immediately struck me was the fact that these researchers only looked at one subreddit. I had been tracking predictions in three: [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/), but also [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/). As such, I feel I can add some perspective that the researchers missed.

(I’m a university student studying theoretical math. This started as a semester-long project in a text mining class, and I present the most relevant results from my findings here. I am not a professional in this field, and this is not financial advice.)

# Data

I wanted to only take predictive posts that mention a particular stock ticker in these subreddits, so I only selected flaired posts – DD in WSB and [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/), and “ticker discussion” in [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/). (I had to exclude [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) since that subreddit does not have flairs). The USF researchers did the same, taking DD posts from WSB.

I also wanted to avoid the GameStop posting frenzy on these subreddits and take predictions old enough so that by April, I could measure their success or failure after at least six months. As such, I selected posts between January 1, 2019 and October 1, 2020.

The team from USF similarly wanted to filter out GameStop frenzy on [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/), but they focused on success or failure of posts over a shorter time interval, looking primarily at two-day returns and three month returns. Their data ranges from 2018 to December 2020, although they do not give specific dates.

I used pushshift to collect my data set. Not sure what the research team used.

# Methods

This distinction is crucial. The team from USF looked at every post in their data set manually and noted the stock ticker mentioned and prediction direction. I used text mining to do this instead. The clear upside to my method is the fact that I was able to look at more posts, especially giving me the ability to compare returns and trends across different subreddits. Obviously, my results are not guaranteed to be perfectly accurate like theirs, though. With that being said, I used a number of text mining approaches, some simple, some sophisticated, and I am confident that my results are very accurate. After using text mining to isolate ticker symbols in these posts, I ended up with over 4000 predictions across all three subreddits (1253 in [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/), 644 in [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), and 2628 in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)).

I also used sentiment analysis to obtain a prediction direction for each of these posts (either buy or sell). The research team, reading every post manually, always isolated the correct prediction direction, but sentiment analysis is more finicky. With that being said, several tests confirmed my method worked very well too. I’ll spare you the details.

I’ll note here too that the researchers collected a lot more data than I am mentioning here, including retail trading volume of particular stocks on the day popular posts were made, and correlation between number of posts made about a stock and that stock’s price change. There’s a lot of cool stuff in their paper. I encourage you [to read all of it.](https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=710087064097089109073116009067086122015017095012001064108080023002087014024122090093101099062003019016045100086115111100005029007087059020059072074070018006118068031021076024031087127076020075109119113072095069023096097001091085000025010076027126000&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE)

# Results!!!

Before I get into results, it is worth noting that the vast majority of these predictions were made during a massive bull run. This section should not be construed as financial advice, nor a suggestion that every post on these subreddits will always have these returns.

I started by looking at 6-month returns on predictions.

[Here are the results as a nice table.](https://imgur.com/F3PzwyR)

In [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/), the median 6-month returns on these predictions was 63%, with mean returns of 234%. This discrepancy is driven in part by the fact that 8% of predictions reached 10x value over the course of 6 months. A natural question arises: maybe all of these predictions that 10x’ed were about the same stock. I checked this, but no single stock ticker was responsible for more than 19% of these 10x predictions.

In [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), median 6-month returns reached 35%, with mean returns of 71%. There were no predictions I collected in my data set during this time frame from [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) that reached 10x value over 6-months. It is possible that those do exist and I failed to scrape the ticker symbol.

In [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/), median 6-month returns reached 34%, with mean returns of 71%. 2% of these predictions 10x’ed. However, I went back and checked these, and \~70% of these 10x predictions were about GME (these were the first few posts before October that started the frenzy, thanks DeepFuckingValue!). Removing these, returns from this subreddit still had median 34%, but mean returns fell to 52%.

A few takeaways – first, these are massive, extremely impressive returns, even during huge bull run. This augments the USF team’s argument that reddit investing communities are NOT misleading retail investors. However, it is worth noting that [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) seems to perform the worst, on average. It does have its reputation for a reason (more on that later).

I also simulated what would have happened if an investor put $1 into prediction in my data set at the time of the prediction, then pulled their money out all at once in March 2021. I compared this to what would have happened if they had put the same amount of money at the same time in VOO.

[Here's another nice table of results](https://imgur.com/qNo6bHC)

[r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) performed the best. I found 1253 predictive posts in this subreddit between January 1, 2019 and October 1, 2020, and if one had invested $1 into the stock mentioned by each prediction, they would have realized 290% returns on their investment by March 2021. If instead they had put this money into VOO at the same time, their returns would only have been 24%. Again, many of these posts were about stocks that ultimately saw at least 5 times increase in value. In [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/), this was a very diverse group of stocks, but Microvision (MVIS) and CleanSpark (CLSK) are two very popular tech companies on this subreddit that each saw their value skyrocket. There were 30 predictions about these companies, and excluding these, returns from this subreddit would still have reached a whopping 250%.

For [r/Stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stocks/), if one had invested $1 into every stock mentioned by predictive posts, they would have realized 152% return on investment on a total of 644 predictions over the same time frame. VOO returns would have only been 24%. However, these returns were driven by the popularity of Tesla (TSLA) on this subreddit, a stock which also grew tremendously in value. Removing 40 predictions about Tesla, returns in [r/Stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stocks/) would only have reached 134%.

In [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/), someone using the same investment strategy would have realized 112% returns by on 2628 predictions from the same time frame. If this investor had put that money into VOO instead, they would have made 26% returns (these posts were made at slightly different times than posts in the previous subreddits, so returns on investments in VOO made at the same time would not necessarily be the same as before). Again, Tesla and GameStop are popular companies on this subreddit that performed well over this time frame. Excluding these, [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) returns would only have reached 77%.

Again, very impressive results, but take them with a grain of salt – it’s been a huge bull run recently. Still, we have to agree with the USF researchers that reddit communities are not misleading retail investors. Although yes, [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) still performed the worst.

# Word Choice

This is my favorite part. I used a (modified version of a) text mining technique called Dunning Log-Likelihood ratio to examine word choice disparity across the three subreddits. In essence, it takes relative word frequency across the three subreddits in addition to how often those words are used to figure out which words are more characteristic of posts on each subreddit.

For example, “the” is used a lot on all three subreddits, but at almost the exact same frequency, so “the” gets a score close to 0. “intercept” is used very rarely in any DD posts, but for some reason a little more often in [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), so it gets a small-to-medium positive score in [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and a negative score in [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) and [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/). “fuck” is used decently often in all three subreddits, but WAYYYY more often in WallStreetBets, so it gets a high positive score in [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) and a negative score in the others.

Here are [the top 40 words](https://imgur.com/a/fI38Wu7) for the three subreddits. Remember, text mining is not perfect, so not all typos are taken out.

In [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/), the top words are as expected – things like “growth,” “dividend,” “opinion,” and “portfolio” rise to the top.

In [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/), I was surprised by how many pharmaceutical terms rose to the top - “fda,” “clinical,” and “development.”

And finally, the [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/) results are glorious. The top 40 words include “shit,” 3 variants of “fuck,” “calls,” “puts,” “tendies,” “autists,” and “retards.”

**Slightly longer tl;dr:** **The USF researchers concluded that** [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) **is not misleading retail investors, since their predictions tend to perform very well. Some took this to mean that traders on** [r/wallstreebets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreebets/) **are skilled, but in fact WSB gets beaten by** [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) **on average, and these both get beaten by predictions on** [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) **(by a lot). See “results” above for exact numbers. This only strengthens the argument that reddit is not misleading retail investors. Also,** [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/) **likes pharmaceuticals, and** [r/wallstreebets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreebets/) **word choice is quantifiably as vulgar and degenerate as we know it to be.

I can't shake the feeling that there's something I'm missing. Some kind of due diligence I'm failing to do because I don't know where to look...

Is there something other than ""stuff with higher returns is on fire sale"" that has an effect on carbon's performance as a commodity?

Submission,nshp3l,Joann Fabrics - Short DD. I am a bull for 'JOAN',HaMEZSmiff,"Ladies and Gents, 

I have modified my investing approach and am now a value investor. My goal is to always buy good companies at bargain prices. 

This is my short DD for ticker symbol “JOAN”, the underlying company is Joann Fabrics. 

This company recently went public again after a ten year hiatus where they were taken private. Currently they have approximately ⅓ of the shares outstanding available for purchase to the public. The remaining ⅔ is owned by Leonard Green & Partners which was the firm that took them private about a decade ago. The ⅔ of shares are currently in lock-up and will remain in lock-up until September (180 days after IPO). 

Revenues 

2019 - $2.314 Billion / 2020 - $2.241 Billion / 2021 - $2.762 Billion 

Net Income 

2019 - $35.3 Million / 2020 - \*(546.6 million) \*/ 2021 - 212.3 Million

A major driver of the negative profit in 2020 was due to 486.8 million goodwill and impairment charge. From the 10-K, “We did record impairment charges of 486.8 million in fiscal 2020, which were predominantly the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, driven primarily by the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season” Ref. (1) 

Now, you may see the 2020 numbers and say, well that seems terrible. You’d be right. 

However, fiscal 2021 was a BLOWOUT year for them. Why? Well, COVID of course, that was the year that all were at home and couldn’t do anything out in town. Because of this they are currently trading at a 2.81 TTM P/E. Now of course, I do not believe they will generate as much top and bottom line in fiscal 2022. However, they have had a lot of favorable trends go their way and likely will continue into the future. Based on the analysts that currently report on JOAN they see it trading at \~5.8 forward P/E which essentially means they think profit will be about half as much as it was last year. That is fair that it will be less, but HALF?

Let’s take a look at their most recent quarterly results which posted yesterday (Q1 Fiscal 2022) 

Net Sales - 574 million vs. 499.4 million in the year prior. 

Net income - 15.1 million vs. (23.6 million) in the year prior.

EPS of $0.39…. Did I forget to mention Q1 and Q2 are traditionally their worst performing quarters? If we assume this EPS sticks for the next four quarters it is currently trading at \~11 FWD P/E. That would also be ridiculously stupid to do, considering net income was 47.7 Million in Q3 ‘fiscal 2021 and 38.3 million in Q4 ‘fiscal 2021.

Now the argument could definitely be made that stimulus and covid played a one-time role in some of these revenues and profits. That would be impossible to calculate so I personally always like to have a margin of safety which is also why I think analysts predicted a forward P/E of about twice as much as it currently trades for on a TTM. So based on that, I will just continue the argument on the \~5.8 Forward P/E. 

Analysts were predicting earnings of $0.18 per share, turns out Joann Fabrics destroyed that and made over double. 

If you take a look at ref (3) which is the highlights from the earnings report or listen to the earnings call on their investor relations page on the website it highlights some significant growth opportunities and long-term trends they see. I will just speak about a few and feel free to check out the others in your own additional DD. 

The arts & crafts business has been reinvigorated because of covid, and it’s here to stay. Look at etsy for example, there are hundreds of thousands of arts and crafts items being crafted every day by people like you and me. (Long term growth potential)

The gross margin improved by 23.1% (that is \*\*\*\*ing huge!) They are able to generate higher tickets, more often. The omni-channel growth was 186% over the past two years (only represents 13% of sales as of now). 

I feel like I’d just be retyping the entire earnings transcript trying to say why this company is going to do phenomenally well in the coming years.

Comparatively, Michaels was taken private in November of last year in a 5 billion dollar deal, which would be one of the closest competitors based off this deal it would value Joann at about $40 or a valuation of 1.8 billion (based off of sales). However, Joann products have higher margins and personally I believe Joann has better growth prospect stories, in store sewing lessons, revamping the Joann consumer experience in new look stores (only a few stores are being re-done a year). 

Did I mention the dividend…? It’s not much, but $0.40/year or $0.10/quarter. Not bad, currently a yield of a little over 2% as of today’s stock price \~$16 ish. 

Some negative things about Joann - They do have \~700 M in long-term debt, all of the IPO money they received went directly to paying down debt and one of their goals this year is to continue to reduce leverage and expect to reach \~650 M in long-term debt by the end of the fiscal year. (I see this as a positive). The CEO clearly has a long-term plan on how this debt will be repaid. 

Headwinds - Shipping cost has been rising significantly due to the economy reopening, this will likely play a key role in margins in the coming quarters. Next quarter will also be the worst of the year on a traditional basis, due to them having to prepare product wise for Q3 and Q4 which traditionally are the best quarters. 

My Bull Thesis - This company is trading at 2.81 TTM P/E, these “expert” analysts think it’s at a 5.8 forward P/E, which I think they are low-balling JOAN, but let’s say they are right. The current market average for P/E is 36.8 and traditional average is 19.6. This is a smaller company and should be trading at a discount compared to a bigger obvious great company like Apple or Johnson and Johnson which both have P/E’s of about 27-29. However, should it be trading \~5-6X cheaper!? I would not be typing this if I thought that was the case. This company has several growth prospects in the future and seems to be run by a solid team that has growth in mind. I think this company should be trading at a forward P/E or TTM P/E (whichever is higher) of about 15 which would lead me to my price target of $44.00. That is assuming I believe the analyst FWD P/E which I think it is low balling. I feel comfortable buying this stock below $30 and I have a personal price target of $50.00

Disclaimer - I am a BULL for JOAN, I do own 2000 shares at an avg price of $14.60. I also have some November calls. 

Now, while I obviously want any of you reading this to look into the company and invest if you think it’s a value play. I do fundamentally believe in this company and their future. My plan is to hold for several years, unless the story somehow goes sour, I do not see that happening in the near-term. If the stock some-how reached above $70 I would likely sell, if it reached above $55 (10% above my own price target) I would likely reduce my position in half. 

\--- I welcome any feedback, I do recognize I have a bias towards this company. If I didn’t, I probably wouldn’t invest in it. 

I hope you find this at least useful in determining whether or not to do your own DD into the company.

Submission,nmwdby,Lessons from an emotional investor/trader,radarbot,"This is a reminder to all emotional investors/traders out there: Don't panic sell!

I made a bunch of stupid moves the week of May 10 when the market was taking its second downturn. If I just walked way from my computer for 2 weeks, most of the moves I made would have recovered. But unstead now I'm sitting on missed gains because I got too emotional.

Investing/trading is not about emotion. It's about having a plan and sticking to it.

I'm terrible at it because I still panic when macro factors test the strength of my plan.

Here are some of the lessons I'd like new traders/investors to really take to heart:

- When you buy a stock, have a VERY clear idea on why you bought, how long you're holding, and what your exit strategy is. I cannot stress this enough. There are many times where I bought a stock to flip, and I ended up holding it long term as a bag holder because I got greedy. And there are many times I bought stock I believed in, but ended up selling it on a correction because I panicked. Be incredibly regimented about this.

- Understand that corrections occur, and make a plan on how you'll deal with it. If you started buying high growth/beta stocks in January or February, you're account is probably down 20% from its peak. Thats okay, take a DEEP breath and think through your strategy. Did you leave any money to DCA your positions down? Ex. You bought ENPH at $220, its $140 right now. Do you still believe in ENPH? Why did you buy it at $220 and what has fundamentally changed about the company now that its at $140?

- Understand the power of averaging down.You can't time tops or bottoms. But you can make a strategy to mitigate risks. If any stocks you own have a beta higher than 2, seriously consider making an average down strategy. Averaging down is a very powerful tool, but you need to plan ahead for it. Stocks are great if they're only going up, but any high growth stock will come back down on small catalysts that throws into jeopardy their future growth. Those things can be macro factors as well such as interest rates and inflation fears. Here's a simple example using NIO. NIO was trading at $64 on January 20 after NIO day. There were definitely people who bought NIO at that price. Lets assume you bought 100 shares of NIO for $6400. NIO since then has been on a brutal slide. Its found its bottom at $31 twice now, but its still unclear what the real bottom is. At the same time, more analysts have reiterated that NIO is a buy with a price target of about $60. So your cost average is $64 with a 100 shares. NIO is sitting at $38 today. You know there's a 20% downside to $31, and maybe it goes lower. But you also know that it has a potential upside to $64. The reality is, if you believe in NIO, and were proactive enough to have $6400 stored in case of an event like this, if you bought 168 shares of NIO for $38, and averaged down your position you're cost average for NIO become a much more reasonable $47 rather than $64. That means NIO only has to gain 20% from its current price rather than 80%. I've seen this written in this subreddit before, but averaging down on a position is one the greatest opportunities. It lets you recommit to the original thesis you had for a stock, and it also creates a more advantageous position in the long term.

That said, be careful of ""buy the dip"". Understand why the dip is occurring. Compare the dip to macro factors like SPY and QQQ. Understand interest rates, inflation, international trade deals and other factors that could affect macro price movement. Use TA to understand support levels, and always be aware that things could drop more. April and May really tested the theory of ""it can't go any lower"". I was reading on this forum that April 27 was the end. That everything was going to recover since high flying stocks were on their bullish trajectory. Then we hit an inflation panic and the market corrected all high growth stocks by about 20%. OUCH.



Here's my big mistake. When I had no extra money to average down, and the stocks kept falling in May, I panicked. I managed to make it through February and March and most of April without panicking and selling. But May did me in. I ended up selling stocks to preserve capital, and most of those stocks are rebounding now and its making me realize that I wasn't as mentally strong as I thought.

Don't make these mistakes I did. Please make a strategy for yourself and stick with it! And don't keep changing strategies on a whim. That's another thing that will lead to compounding losses rather than tweaking and honing your strategy for what works for you!",Advice,,24,t3_nmwdby,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nmwdby/lessons_from_an_emotional_investortrader/,21,0.76,[1622203498.0]

Submission,nbmc72,Renewable Energy Stocks to buy on this Discount?,TheBullishPanda,"So with almost all of the Renewable Energy Stocks a good way down from their all time highs and the charts looking like most hit a bottom formation, what stocks are most likely to bounce back  strong?

I personally think, that if from China to the US everybody is on board with changing the energy production to renewables and the strong development of the sector despite the pandemic in 2020, it should be very likely, that we see at least a strong decade for renewable energy stocks.

While researching what stocks are best positioned to profit from Governments trying to make a switch in energy production and at the same time are relatively stable during inflation and rising interest rates, I came to the conclusion, that I wanted to invest in companies that are already profitable an so well financed, that they are able to pay out dividends.

While the US market is relatively small for such companies, countries that are more advanced in their energy production do have some stocks that fit. Europe, Canada and China are clearly ahead in renewables and I would love to get some inspiration on where to look for more companies like this.Also I would be very interested in feedback on the stocks I have come up with doing my own DD. Those are:

Encavis (Germany)

Xinjiang Goldwind (China)

Northland Power (Canada)

Vestas (Denmark)

TransAlta Renewables (Canada)

7c Solarparken (Germany)

Submission,nsmpfx,"Lululemon first-quarter sales rise 88%, topping estimates, as store traffic rebounds",Asleep_Cup_1337,"Lululemon Athletica said Thursday its fiscal first-quarter revenue soared 88%, topping analysts’ estimates, as shopper traffic steadily rebounded to its stores.

The athletic apparel maker also issued a strong forecast for its fiscal second quarter and raised full-year estimates, saying momentum for its brand is growing across all geographies.


Its stock rose less than 1% on the news in extended trading.

Here’s how Lululemon did for the period ended May 2, compared with what analysts were anticipating, based on a Refinitiv survey:

Earnings per share: $1.16 adjusted vs. 91 cents expected
Revenue: $1.23 billion vs. $1.13 billion expected
Net income grew to $145 million, or $1.11 per share, from $28.6 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, Lululemon earned $1.16 a share, better than the 91 cents per shares that analysts estimated.

Revenue rose to $1.23 billion from $652 million a year earlier, when its stores were temporarily shut. That came in ahead of expectations for $1.13 billion.

On a two-year basis, sales grew 57%. Lululemon also said its men’s business grew faster from 2019 levels than its women’s.


The Covid pandemic has fueled shopper demand for fitness gear to wear around the house and to dress for at-home workouts such as running and spin biking. The trend, which hasn’t appeared to slow down, has benefited companies including Lululemon, Nike and Under Armour. It has also boosted more traditional retailers such as Gap, which recently said activewear sales continue to drive sales at both its Athleta and Old Navy banners.

Lululemon’s direct-to-consumer revenue climbed 55% to $545.1 million year over year. Sales in North America were up 82% and increased 125% internationally.

CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts Thursday that Lululemon still expects its international business will grow in size to be equal to its North American operations in the near future. At the end of 2020, international sales represented only 14% of Lululemon’s total business.

The company also owns the at-home fitness platform Mirror, a rival to Peloton. Lululemon expects Mirror to drive between $250 million and $275 million in revenue this year.

CFO Meghan Frank said momentum has remained strong in recent weeks. The company continues to invest in innovative merchandise to drum up excitement. It recently launched a line of products that use lower-impact dyes, and it is piloting a trade-in and resale program.

For its fiscal second quarter, Lululemon expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.10 to $1.15, on sales of $1.3 billion to $1.33 billion. Analysts had been looking for earnings of $1.01 per share on revenue of $1.20 billion, according to a Refinitiv survey.

For the year, it’s calling for adjusted earnings of $6.73 to $6.86 per share, on sales of $5.83 billion to $5.91 billion. Analysts expected it to earn $6.48 per share on sales of $5.68 billion.

Previously, Lululemon had been calling for fiscal 2021 revenue to be in a range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion.

“We were performing well before the pandemic, I think we led the peer group during the pandemic, and we’re excited about ... our ability to continue to perform post-pandemic,” McDonald said.

Lululemon shares are down about 9% year to date. It has a market cap of $41.4 billion. Lululemon Athletica said Thursday its fiscal first-quarter revenue soared 88%, topping analysts’ estimates, as shopper traffic steadily rebounded to its stores.

My current question is about margin buying. I was recently offered the ability to use margin buying on RH and was given an $11,000 margin which seems dangerous to me because from what I have gleaned from my research, buying on margin is like using credit from whatever platform you’re using to invest. 
Let’s say I use $500 on the margin to buy stock, when I deposit more money will they automatically take that $500 back? Is that how you pay it off? Are they making money off of this? Like hidden fees and exorbitant interest rates and stuff like that?I guess what I mean is, overall, is it sketchy? Should I avoid buying on a margin? 
One reason I’ve seen given as a benefit is that you’re able to buy more stock at the time when you need to and therefore can make more profit because it gives you additional capital to invest. That makes sense, but again I wonder what their angle is. I really don’t want to get myself in a bad situation because I’m ignorant. Any advice or experience on the matter would be greatly appreciated!",Advice,,39,t3_ndw3uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ndw3uz/trying_to_understand_the_pros_and_cons_of_buying/,21,0.71,[1621193991.0]
Submission,nccegs,Opinion on Stock Youtubers,Rickysmalls1010-,"So I have been watching stock youtubers for about 2 years now. While I say some are present good information, I believe that some definitely are not teaching good fundamentals and risk management. Especially when I see the thumbnail with 10X stock or some just wanting you to throw your money in any random stock. I believe this will cause the exact opposite of what should happen where you should always do your own research. 

Watching youtubers that have super risky options and stocks creates a confirmation bias to do the same thing as them whereas they have more capital than most of us, and they get paid a lot of money making these YouTube videos via google adworks.
In essence without doing a lot of your OWN research it’s basically gambling and you need to invest more cognitively. 
These youtubers should only be used as a means to get new ideas to look into stocks and not to blindly follow them.",,,44,t3_nccegs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nccegs/opinion_on_stock_youtubers/,21,0.76,[1621008936.0]
Submission,nbo9z0,SQ is trading at an absolute bargain right now,HubertNeutron,"I just wanna point this out for people who might be afraid to buy this stock right now. SQ is trading at a 7 PS ratio, that’s more than half of what it was on dec 22nd 2020. 

The only times it’s traded at a lower PS ratio than this post 2017 were Dec 2018, Aug 2019-Jan 2020 and March 2020 - May 2020. If you bought this stock in June 2020 or February 2020 you were buying it at an 8 PS ratio which is a higher valuation than what it is today.

Let’s compare this to PYPL. PYPL is growing at a steady 30% Y/Y and currently trading at a 12 PS ratio. SQs revenue growth Y/Y for the latest quarter is 266% and for the 2 previous ones it was over 100% for both. So SQ is growing revenue this fast yet trading at 2/3 the value of PYPL

Also in June 2020 PYPL reported 5.26 billion in revenue and had a market cap of around 180 billion, last quarter SQ reported 5.06 billion in revenue and has a market cap of 89 billion

With a valuation like this how much more will these growth stocks sell off? and why are people afraid to buy more with bargains like this

Edit: I don’t know where people’s brains are, they don’t understand how fast software as a service can grow, Bitcoin is 9% of their revenue, if they lost all that than ok a 9 PS ratio? That’s the value it was in February of 2020 and still cheaper than PYPL, even if you don’t include their crypto revenue SQ grew over 100% Y/Y and their monthly user base will continue to grow",Company Discussion,,114,t3_nbo9z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nbo9z0/sq_is_trading_at_an_absolute_bargain_right_now/,21,0.61,[1620932159.0]

Tesla delivered a record number of cars out of it's Shanghai Factory in April.

They delivered over 40,000 cars in April and are continuing to increase their production ramp.

Fremont delivered over 100,000 cars in Q1 and they did not produce any Model S or Model X vehicles due to parts shortages. They are set to begin deliveries for the Model S in Q2 so their production out of Fremont should be higher than Q1 and with Tesla now producing over 40k a month in Shanghai they could conservatively at this pace reach north of 225k in Q2. They might be significantly higher than 225 with them already at 40k out of Shanghai the first month of the quarter.

Estimates seem to be in the 195-205k range.




Edit: Seems the information was misinterpreted and the actual numbers were about 25k out of Shanghai in April. The factory had shutdowns for 2 weeks. I still think this is bullish that they were able to pump out 25k in the month of April with factory shut downs for 2 weeks. They should clear 100k easily in the quarter out of Shanghai and 100k easily out of Fremont. Estimate for the quarter now 210k and potentially more depending on how much they can ramp Shanghai in May and June.


Edit a second time:

It's actually unclear which version is accurate at this point as crazy as that sounds. A lot of misinformation floating around.

Submission,n748z0,Why I'm XXXX in CRSR.,daftstar,"I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6t5n6/corsair_gaming_crsr_criminally_undervalued/) in WSB re: CRSR ([/u/idiotbarney](https://www.reddit.com/user/idiotbarney/)) and it made me wonder why CRSR seems so criminally undervalued. In short, it seems like the entire tech sector went out of favor for the last quarter. But... if there's a turnaround in the segment, they have some good lights ahead of them. 

TL;DR - Why I'm invested in them. I really do like the company. I'm big into these guys. Maybe with GME's PC Sales push, that'll shine some light on CRSR. Maybe they'll get bought out by MSFT or AMZN who wants a more substantial play into the gaming and streaming market. Not sure, but I'm long on the stock with XXXX shares. 

**Positions**:

*  XXXX shares
* Dec 17 2021 $35C

# Good Stuff

**1) Cash flow from operating activities** (their core product) is increasing YoY and QoQ. This is really good and healthy. 

**2) Inventory turnover** (how many times a company sells its entire inventory stock) has been growing double digit %s for the past four years. That means that people want CRSR's product. But maybe CRSR is leaving money on the table because they're constantly out of stock?

**3) Financial stability** \- they have solid growth in their free cash flow. Their quick ratio is < 1 which is not great, but their current ratio is > 1 which is good (quick = if they had to liquidate everything today, could they cover their debt ... current = are they being hamstrung by debt payments (no they are not)). 

**4) Stock value** \- they've given up 33% of their value from 3 months ago. This entire past quarter (for almost the entire tech market it seems) has been a massive haircut. They're consolidating around the low $30s - which if the tech market turns around should be a really healthy thing for CRSR. 

# Okay Stuff

**5) Branding** \- these guys are operating in a very fragmented space. They're doing the right things with branding, but in the market overall, they're still very much an unheard of name. They're kind of like how Sonos was almost 10 years ago. If Corsair can find a way to get more into the mainstream, then they're golden.  

**6) Leadership -** this is the only iffy thing I see with them. They have a solid stack of leadership, but nothing really strikes me as a notable in terms of them pushing for bigger / greater things. As I mentioned before CRSR plays in an ultra-fragmented industry. Sure the big streamers and maybe most of you here know about the name, but a vast majority of people don't. Leadership needs to change this. Point in case, more ppl know about CRSR from streaming and reddit than from anything that leadership is really doing.

Submission,nlxtdz,$SNOW SNOWFLAKE hits estimate on earnings. Guidance calls for decline in product revenue,putsonbears,"Snowflake stock fell as much as 7% then rebounded in extended trading on Wednesday after the data analytics software company gave full-year guidance that met but did not exceed analysts’ estimates. 

**Here’s how the company did:**

Earnings: Loss of 70 cents per share
Revenue: $190.5 million, vs. $178.5 million as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
The company’s revenue increased by 117% on an annualized basis in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31, according to a statement. In the prior quarter had grown 119%. The company’s net loss widened to about $199 million from $83 million in the year-ago quarter.

“We have implemented operations that will help us show more profitability,” finance chief Mike Scarpelli said during a conference call with analysts. “We’re continuing to invest heavily in the business.”

The company also said in a regulatory filing that as of Monday it had gotten rid of its dual-class structure, in which Class A shares got one vote per share and Class B shares got 10 votes per share. The structure had been in place since September, when Snowflake stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Now, all Class B shares will be converted into Class A shares.

With respect to guidance, Snowflake said it expects $195 million to $200 million in product revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which would be up 92% to 96% year over year. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for $196.3 million in product revenue. Almost 94% of Snowflake’s revenue came from product revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter.

For the full 2022 fiscal year, the company sees $1.00 billion to $1.02 billion in product revenue, representing 81% to 84% growth, a decline from 116% product revenue growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $1.01 billion in product revenue.

$SNOW fell 3.08% after-market close today to $228.00

* When you are researching a stock, what do you usually take a look at? Do you just do research on google and see where it takes you, or do you have a usual way of proceeding?
* Do you often go on YouTube to learn more about a stock? If you do, what do  you usually expect from a video you are watching? Is it more general information like how the business works, what the industry looks like, what are the financials? Or is it more for technical analysis with charts and everything?
* When listening to a video, what is the most crucial information you want to have to feel like the video was not a complete waste of your time?
* Finally, is there anything you love from certain youtubers that make you come back? Or that you hate and make you never click on their video again?

Submission,nh2yi0,SQM and lithium demand,third_legatron,"I have been out of lithium miners since the beginning of this year after I exited my Livent position at what I thought was a peak at ~$20 per share. As I see them rally again I decided to look into more value oriented plays. Although I am a big fan of mining companies currently, I though that lithium miners we're about priced in when it came to forward demand. 

That being said, I have always still kept an eye on stocks such as albemarle and SQM. SQM seems to be at a very good value standpoint right now after they got beat up due to the chilean government transition. I believe at this point the stock is oversold and now is a good time to take a position. The company trades at a relatively high p/e right now, but I believe higher lithium prices and higher quality lithium demand will be a factor in their growth moving forward to 2022 and 2023. 

SQM's long term debt stands at just under $2b, which I do not think is terrible given how much of it was acquired during covid. They are also not a lithium pure play, and have a sizable portion of the market for iodine, which is used in the medical field as well as potassium nitrates for fertilizers. Their main income is definitely from lithium and this will continue to be true.

They have a joint venture in Australia that is supposedly coming online in the middle of this year that is focused on production of lithium hydroxide. This is a risk it seems as SQM has not produced lithium from a hard rock project it seems and this holds execution risk, although I am not worried much about it, it is worth noting. Another risk would be the chilean government altering land agreements and taxes, which is also probably not too much of a worry as lithium is taxed heavily as is. The land agreements even less so because most changes to land would be for private entities, and SQM leases their land from the government. 

All in all, the risk reward on this stock after the sell off seems relatively solid and I have initiated a position and plan to hold/dca down if the opportunity presents. Lithium prices are still quite low and the company doing better will depend on the lithium prices creeping up for the next few years as demand is supposed to increase substantially. 

Albemarle is also a great company, I haven't read up on them too much, but I believe at a quick glance, you could get away with starting a position now and averaging down if the chance presents itself. These are my the 2 companies that I would recommend to actually go long on for lithium mining. The LIT ETF is also good, but I prefer individual stock picking.",Company Discussion,,10,t3_nh2yi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nh2yi0/sqm_and_lithium_demand/,19,0.84,[1621523952.0]

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Finally i try to find some smart opinions on Reddit and maybe discuss the stock with someone else.

Any suggestion ?

Submission,ncl56i,Why I Think AMC Will Result In Bagholders,Fishonamission2,"Alright, this will be quite unpopular, but I don't buy this AMC will squeeze to the moon thesis for a few reasons.

Let’s look at liquidity:

AMC had $813m in cash as of 3/31/21. Since then they’ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is \~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there’s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.

Next there's the valuation:

Forget covid and let’s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today’s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is $16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was $4.0b vs. $5.8b today.

Conclusion:

AMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. \~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn’t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.

The current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.

If I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute the share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don’t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It’s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.

A lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it’s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme.

Submission,n8ivcc,HeWhoSleepsNot random ass weekly report for the markets 5/9/2021 edition,hewhosleepsnot,"Hello Everybody! [Echo- Hello Doctor Nick!]

It’s me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

Now lets get into it, shall we?

From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for. A couple of ETF’s mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set:

ETFs:
   ICLN- etf focusing on clean energy, should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden. I own a couple shares and so does my spouse. 
   TAN- solar ETF, same rationale as above
   PBW- clean energy ETF, same rational as above.

   Then we have $RKT [Rocket Companies, including Rocket Mortgage] Innovation in an old field. Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field. During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout.
   All 24,000 employees had shares during to/prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally.
   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24.75 and it was ~22.65 so only a small upside at current prices.
   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below. Not sure yet. I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report. I am long a handful of shares here. 


From Swaggy stock reads:

   DKNG! I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler. THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20-40% market share varying by state [or sport- I forget and deleted the email so /shrug, I’m good like that]. Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM. Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues.
   And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight! That is some dedication [or addiction- and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals]

From some MarketBeat emails/website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades:

CSX director sold 1.4 million shares at an average of 100.93 worth ~142 million and now only owns 12,399 shares worth ~1.2 million. This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares. Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure.

FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car! (I own both tickers)

From market sentiment we have some facts:

RKT fell 16% Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236% and net income up 170% but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations. May be good entry point if you’re bullish long term. Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year+ and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming.(I own some shares and thinking of selling short term cash secured puts depending on the premium)

Etsy was down 13% at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing. (Own a handful)

Corsair 6% down despite exceptional growth. 


And finally, from pits most foul, the depths of my memory:

GDRX- discount pharmacy deals, makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC, was ~38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of ~53. Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled, which is certainly a concern right now.(have about a grand in here so one of my small mid positions)

AAPL- quietly making acquisitions. Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing, or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do, AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field. I’m sure you’ve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating. The amount of product apple sells is INSANE, but that’s why their market cap is also INSANE! I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition [think AI, AR, VR]. Currently have 5-7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127. 

I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply, so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size, so that’s some storage business. Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings. I am long PSA and SAFE, maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn’t spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space.

SCI- have about a grand here. Cemetery’s and death shit. People always be dying. Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in. Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56.88 and currently ~56.71, 1.57% dividend, 19.69 P/E ratio]

AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and....growing until government intervention. One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock. My response: Cash burn at Blue Origin [private space company] has to be huge right now, so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales. Then again he also has access to private companies/venture caps so he’s investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/amazon-ceo-bezos-sells-nearly-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares.html (I am
Long Amazon)

NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand.( I am long)

DG- another recession play. Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233.12, 0.78% dividend, currently ~216. (I am long)

Defensive stocks like grocery stores, essential suppliers, utility companies, etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you’re 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days.

CLX- i have some of this. Clorox. I think people will have germs on the mind for a while. I don’t know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500% since last March, wish my gains matched! Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic. Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191.92 and dividend of 2.46%.

I have been trying to find the right balance of dividends and capital gains in a portfolio.

Submission,nmdmxn,Which stock do you believe will see the most growth in the next 2 years?,putsonbears,"My Long core positions consist of: VTI, MSFT, AAPL. I am in the market to either add to these long positions, or open a new one. Objective is to liquidate with most possible profit in +2 years.

Here is my choice. Not a huge surprise but nonetheless:

FB - I think it is the most undervalued FAANG+M stock as of now. Additionally, compared to AAPL, MSFT, GOOG - it is much less mature and has lot more room for growth. I think the data limitations posed by AAPL will not have the major effect that some think.

FB had a great earnings with strong guidance. Analysts have a median price target of $394.75 (+20%) in 12-months with a high of $460.

Submission,nmeny2,FIGS IPO Debuted Today,FormalExperience,"FIGS, an apparel and lifestyle company for healthcare workers, officially went public today. They mainly sell nicer, more professional looking scrubs that are becoming more of a fashion statement (almost think Lululemon for scrubs).

Net revenue for this company grew to $261 million in 2020 from $110.5 million in 2019. The company grew from $17.6 million in 2017, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 146%. 

Valuation of $4.6 billion. The IPO priced at $22 a share, which was above the expected range of $16 and $19 a share. It soared out the gate at 36%, reaching a peak of  ~$30.70, currently trading around $29.50.

Did not know this company went IPO today until I got an email from them on their server list. As a healthcare worker and FIGS fanatic I’m excited about this but unsure about the valuation. I do believe they’re a great company and they have a crazy fanbase, almost cult like. Their scrubs are pricey but they have loyal fans and we’ve seen companies with super loyal fans obviously do really well.

What are your thoughts on this IPO?

Today it was finally confirmed. 

A quote directly from Royal Helium’s CEO 

“Andrew Davidson, President and CEO of Royal states, ""we are exceptionally pleased with this discovery at Climax. The Regolith appears to be helium charged over a significant interval and, once the production methodology is determined, it has the potential to be one of the largest helium discoveries in Saskatchewan history.”

Royal Helium - RHC.V one step away from production 

“Production planning will commence shortly on Climax-1, with the intent of producing and monetizing the helium, CO2, and nitrogen gas streams. Discussions with potential processing partners are underway and Royal will report once a gas processing agreement and off-take agreement(s) are in place.”

*A drilled helium well, once all the testing is complete, can start producing almost immediately. 

Royal helium plans on using a membrane system in order to filter the various gases from the well. Helium, being the smallest molecule, will be the gas left over in the end. The system is relatively small, about the size of a C-can, and the gas can be loaded directly from the wellhead.

Basically, Royal helium intends to use a transport truck which will carry a number of large cylinders. They intend to fill the cylinders at the wellhead and then transport them to a plant in Montana. The drive will take approximately 4-6 hours. Also, NA helium has a processing plant right next door.

Another method of generating revenue will be for outside companies to bring in their own equipment and purchase their helium directly from the wellhead.

This will also open the door for other Dynamic revenue sources, but at the time of this writing, I was not able to find more details.

The revenues generated from these first 3 wells will be used to finance the drilling operations on further wells, hence creating more revenue and starting a snowball effect. Royal helium estimates that it will take 6 months for a well to recover its cost of drilling and testing followed by 9.5 years of profit per well.*

The train is about to leave the station to the rocket pad. $RHC.V, at 56c a share, is a steal and it won’t last long.

They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there was a pretty penny.

I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or….any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it. I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn.

Submission,n6xphy,CRWD valuation and upcoming earnings on May 31,radarbot,"Crowdstrike is a cyber security company that provides end host security to prevent breaches and data theft. They have earnings on June 3 for Q1FY22. They posted Q4FY21 earnings on March 18, at one of the brutal red days of the Nasdaq+tech fuckfest.

Currently, CRWD is trading at December 17 levels. Lets take a look at its current valuation and try to understand its short term and long term upsides. We can also compare CRWD to NET and see where the valuations sit.

First lets look at Q4 and FY2021.

https://ir.crowdstrike.com/node/8906/html

The biggest thing to note here is that CRWD is on a 100% yoy revenue trajectory. This is impressive as they've done this for 4 years straight. In FY2021, they were able to pull in $874M revenue, growth of 81% yoy. Their profit also grew 89% comparatively as they were able to drive down the costs of both their product and services increasing margin for both.

Taking into account FY21 revenue, their current P/S value is 48 (42B mktcap by 874M sales). If CRWD announces first quarter revenue of $380M, which would project it for another 80% YoY growth, then consider the stock price to go back up to $220 as we'll try to project to a P/S of 48. If CRWD earnings drop below that, I could see the stock drop to $150 at growth has slowed and the P/S would no longer justify its valuation.

Looking at their projections from their April investor relations deck:
https://ir.crowdstrike.com/static-files/2852082c-2ce8-4d5d-96ad-0e2cb1bd8edc

CRWD is expecting to hit $3Bn ARR in 2025. As of FY2021, they are are $1Bn ARR. 

Overall, I think CRWD is fairly priced currently at $190 compared to other high performing industryplayers. I think CRWD can easily get to $220 based on speculation or if they have a good revenue Q1. I think $240 is very reasonable by end of year due to secular trends in security concerns. Their investor presentation is compelling, showing large TAM growth and tailwinds in cybersecurity. Additionally, over the next 4 years, CRWD is planning to release new products that break into new markets that increase their TAM by 2x (from 44Bn in 2021 to 106Bn in FY25). Compare this to how the market reacted when NET released their serverless platform and the stock jumped 15%. Tackling a new market creates strong tailwinds in growth.

Betting on CRWD at this current price is betting that cyber security and endpoint protection will be critical for large businesses going forward. Do you believe that corporations will see nation state and corporate sponsored cyber security attacks going forward? If so, Crowdstrike is a place you should be seriously considering putting money.

I got into CRWD at $185, but I unfortunately averaged up to a cost average of $209. Seeing CRWD at $190 feels like a fair price, and anything below $180 feels like a deal. The upside potential with regards to risk/reward feels good below $180. At around $200, it could go either way and you may just break even short term.

Long term, I think CRWD has the legs to grow 20% this year.",Company Discussion,,10,t3_n6xphy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6xphy/crwd_valuation_and_upcoming_earnings_on_may_31/,16,0.91,[1620391716.0]

$CPRI - Amazing uptrend that is consolidating, ready to pop. I want in lower, for a good risk v reward, and then when it takes off we should see a good move.

&#x200B;

$GBIO - We need some life, but if it does get a little lower it will be a great play. I need it around $28.90 myself.

&#x200B;

$HELE - Amazing horizontal triangle forming here. We just have to keep a higher low, and let this bad boy build up then rip.

&#x200B;

$MLM  - Amazing uptrend, right at value, we just need to see some life. Could be an easy $20 return fairly quickly.

&#x200B;

$PLNT - I think we are a bit high, I need a better deal or some life. It often crosses $75 so around there may be optimal.

&#x200B;

$PVH  - Already showing life since I shouted it out, and it reverses very quickly. It may be a good play to find confirmation then let it run.

Submission,nptdkn,"Morning Update for Tuesday, 06/01/21",vanturetrading,"Good morning everyone.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP: BABA, NIO, AMD, BA, UAL, CLDR, AMC

Gapping DOWN: ZIM, CVAC, LEDS

**Momentum Watchlist**

* VTNR (+25%): Up on momentum from past couple days of trading, as well as another price target upgrade. Seeing good volume and price action in premarket. Could see more upwards movement today with the momentum, but I'll be cautious, as this could get over-extended. 
* OEG (+45%): Up after announcing its recently acquired subsidiary reached an agreement for a 700-mile construction project in Mississippi. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues.
* LCTX (+10%): Up after reporting additional cases of retinal tissue restoration in patients treated with their drug. Seeing okay volume and price action in premarket. Daily chart looks bullish so I'll be keeping an eye on this one. 
* AKBA (+8%): Up after FDA set action date for their anemia drug. Seeing decent price action and volume in premarket. 
* APOP (+13%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Daily chart looks bullish, so I'll be keeping an eye on this one.

**Market Outlook:**

The market is showing strength this morning, and stocks are looking to open higher after the long weekend. SPY is trading just over 422, and we should finally see that push to new ATH. DIA is a bit further off from ATH levels, trading just above 348. Tech stocks are up in premarket, but lagging a bit behind the overall market. Gold and silver are green at the moment, and crude oil is up quite a bit this morning. Bitcoin is currently trading around 36,400, and most cryptos look pretty bearish at the moment. Crypto-related stocks are somewhat mixed in premarket trading. Marijuana stocks are showing some strength in premarket trading and are worth following with some potential upcoming catalysts. HITID (new ticker HITI) is being uplisted to Nasdaq today, so it will be one to watch in the near future. Meme stocks are also showing signs of continued strength, and will be worth following this week.

Submission,no5s14,ETF investing VS. stock picking in the long run...,Vergenation,"Every private  stock investor is different, but we all are gifted and doomed with our emotions, such as greed and fear. We think we could find stocks, that are undervalued. Some even try to spot tenbaggers, which to me is the elite within the elite. 

Why do we think we can beat the markets long-term? Like... these big banks and funds didn't have armies of analysts from elite business schools for any given stock. 

I don't doubt many ppl in here are profitable, do good research and are way better investors than I am. Same time, markets seem to decouple from many rules they teached in the books the last decades and even the biggest ships can sink for reasons, we don't know yet.

Short play: the markets are getting harder to make a buck off every year. 

Correct me if I m wrong but isn't stock picking an illusion to most people in here? 
Like even if your research was right, markets still can behave irrational af. Look at tech: crazy earnings -> stocks go down. Afterwards, everyone expected this of course.

If I bought two ETFs such as MSCI ACWI + Small Caps (or let it be MSCI World and Emerging markets) and kept 15-20% cash in the account to buy in market crashes ( no dips, I'm talking when sh*t hits the fan -25 to -40%), won't I ALWAYS have the better performance after 20-30 years? 

Anyone can pick good stocks, may it be knowledge or simply luck. But how long can you go on? How many in here posting ideas have constantly beaten markets over decades? Since Covid, everyone could make money just be long something.

Submission,nhh78w,(DJCO) My mini-essay investment thesis for The Daily Journal - Why you should buy a dying newspaper business,PM_Me_Things_Yo_Like,"Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we’d begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won’t spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper’s most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal’s intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger’s investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal’s American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal’s equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I’ll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal’s business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it’s just not a high value and in all honesty, I don’t know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client’s needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal’s current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal’s practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I’m sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

I'm holding a small position in **NVIDIA** (making self-driving car CPU), **QCOM** stock (making 5G chip), and one other Chinese stock (**HD map and geospatial data provider**).

I personally think TSLA is overpriced. Tesla's self-current driving is only **L2 enhanced** (not even L3). Other carmakers are catching up, some even surpassed Tesla's self-driving technology. With that being said, I still think **Tesla will be one of the formidable players in the future due to its great innovation and Elon's leadership.**

Constructive feedback is welcome

**Edit #1:**

After a good conversation with our members in this group, I have come up with the over ideas and want to sum them up so it's easy for everyone to follow.

A. There are currently two main approaches to self-learning car. Pure vision and (HD Map + Lidar).

**1. Pure vision:** This is how Tesla approaches self-driving technologies. They collect a lot of data and crunch them into a machine learning model. The more data the better becomes. This costs a lot of money and time to perfect the art. **This is analogous to the test bank crammer method.** A student purchases a lot of old tests from the test bank and studies from them only. The more the tests taken, the more confident the student will be.

**Pro of Pure Vision:**

\- Can dynamically perform better than HD map + lidar on a totally new road condition.

\-Lower CapEx- >Save a lot of money to make the car. Tesla only needs cameras, no need to use Lidar (Lidar and HD Map adds a lot of money).

&#x200B;

**Con of Pure Vision:**

\-  But is it true learning, Tesla has been crunching data for more than a decade, and it's still L2 only.

\-  No communication between cars because each car acting as an individual. What happens if each automaker comes with a different classification? Will that cause an issue of random behavior?

&#x200B;

**2.HD Map and Lidar:** This is how the rest of the world is doing. China's government gives a lot of insight into this field due to the securities issue. There is pre-defined HD map already recorded and built into each car. Each car then uses the Lidar to navigate and re-evaluates the map. The more car participates, the better resolution of the map.

**Pro of HD Map and Lidar:**

\-Perform much better than pure vision on a known road condition. If all the car uses the same HD map and there is a central sensor hub, each car will know exactly the location of the other cars miles ahead. Very precise and much less chance of accident compared to pure vision

\-This is the only way to get to L5 and smart IoT (in my opinion). There must be a way for cars to communicate with smart traffic lights, smart drones. A central spatial data bank can resolve this.

\- Lower OpEx-> The carmaker can partner with a Spatial data provider and go from there. No need to spends years, human lives and tons of money again to collect data from scratch.

**Con of HD map and Lidar:**

\-Single point of failure:   If the 5G IoT goes wrong, it can cause massive accidents for example.

\-The car can only drive on known roads, it cannot go anywhere like Tesla cars.

&#x200B;

Let's talk about security here and this will give you some insight. The Chinese government has restricted Tesla from collecting data because they think Tesla is spying on them. If Tesla cannot collect data, how can Tesla finds data that fit into the machine learning model and train it? **I think Tesla eventually has to abandon pure vision in China and forced to use HD map in the future due to securities issues.**

Let's talk about the software liability issue. The question is can software determine life and death of a human. I think this question will be relevant to the short-term because there are still human drivers on the road, but once we get to the stage where human drivers are not allowed. The government can resolve this. We need some universal standardsto resolve this issue.

Let's talk about EV cars. **Do you think self-driving cars will be bullish or bearish to car makers? I personally think it's bearish** **and very few car makers will survive**. A self-driving car needs to be extremely reliable. People will purchase way less cars than before because there will be fewer accidents. EV cars are also more durable than ICE cars. The true market to self-driving car technology is spatial data, and big tech companies like Google / Apple / Microsoft/ Amazon /Tesla have a significant edge in this area. **It's just like smartphone markets, there will be a lot of phone makers selling phones but the weak ones will go out of business (LG has abandoned making smartphones for example). The true profits lie in the App Stores/ Ads.**

Submission,nd8qdc,Discussing the risks associated with stocks,RumHam1,"One thing that I think isnt talked about enough on this sub is risk.  I see a lot of posts and comments from people upset about their investment/trading choices not working out, and I think a lot of that comes from a lack of acknowledgement of the risks associated with stocks.  It often times seems as though people interpret 'high risk/high reward' as 'most likely high reward with maybe a small short term downside'.

This post isnt meant endorse a bear or a bull case in general - make your own decisions based on your research.  This post is more to encourage people to try to better understand the downside possibilities of different positions.

For starters, an all stock portfolio, even one where you're only invested in passive tracking funds, has historically been considered pretty high risk.  SPY was around $150 in 2000, and touched the $80s in 2002 and 2008.  This represents more than a 40% loss for someone who didnt dca into it during that period.  People starting out this year should acknowledge that sort of thing could possibly happen over the next 8 years, even if you don't think it will.  

Individual stocks, even the safe, mature dividend stocks, can fluctuate greatly depending on market conditions.  Competition pops up, costs increase, demand shifts, technology changes.  Nothing is 100% safe from a large drop given a bad turn of events.  Highly speculative stocks without earnings are even more sensitive and susceptible to large drops as we've seen recently.  Maybe these stocks continue to grow in anticipation of big future earnings, but they've also got the potential to lose most of their value if the market conditions turn against them.

Before I buy a stock, I go through the history and outlook for that company and also for that industry.  I take special note of downturns and acknowledge what I think is a reasonable downside for that particular stock.  Acknowledging and accepting those risks help me stay away from trades that are higher risk than I actually want, and helps me keep my conviction when my choices are struggling.

If you're new to investing and trading, make sure you give enough thought to how far the stock or etf you're researching could fall, and make a reasonable decision on if that fits with your appetite for risk.",,,15,t3_nd8qdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nd8qdc/discussing_the_risks_associated_with_stocks/,16,0.91,[1621113470.0]

Submission,nn0q2o,Get Alerted of High Quality DD Posts,wishful_thinking90,"# Motivation

Among the sea of shitposts, memes, gain and loss porn, Wallstreetbets also has some of the best DD I have ever read. From $PRPL, to steel gang, to $GME and beyond, there has been a wealth of incredible DDs on WSB. Unfortunately, there are two issues with DD posted on WSB:

- It is easy to miss the high quality DD among the memes and shitposts
- Once a post has reached the front page and gained thousands of upvotes, the ticker being recommended may already have seen the implied vol on call options shoot up enormously. Sometimes, depending on the ticker, the popularity of a DD post may even move the stock price itself.

Given the wealth of information contained in these DD posts, it would be useful to have an alert system to inform whether a new DD post has been created, and particularly, one that is perceived to be of high enough quality to reach the front page through Reddit's upvote system. 

# My Solution: a Python WSB DD scraper and alert system

I built a Python tool that scrapes WSB every 5 minutes throughout the day and searches through posts which are flaired as ""DD"" and are 30-35 minutes old. Several pieces of information are extracted from those posts, such as their score, the authors' karma, average comment sentiment, as well as a couple engineered features. This information is stored in a dataframe which contains all the day's DD posts. The user can elect to receive email alerts if one of those DD posts reaches the front page (defined as the top 25 posts when sorted under ""Hot""). In addition, the user has the ability to include a model to predict which posts will reach the front page in advance based on the features being scraped. If included, the tool will send email alert when a post is scraped which has a high probability of reaching the front page.

If interested, you can access the code here:
https://github.com/CuriousByNature/WSBFrontPageAlert

The README has a full set of instructions for executing the code. The repository also comes with a sample model object trained to predict whether posts will reach the front page using only on one of my engineered features. The model is able to make predictions with just under 90% out-of-sample precision.

Submission,nhiyel,How will reopening affect Amazon?,usernaame001,"I am also posting this on r/investing, so sorry about the duplicate if it applies to you.

Hi all,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Submission,nfl6c8,Details behind AT&T’s debt (cross posted),Dowdell2008,"The article in NYT outlines why ATT has all this horrible debt. Sounds like incompetence. All three deals were failures. And take a look at that last paragraph below. They spent over $150M just in advisory fees in 3 years to end up where they were to begin with but with more debt.  “After all of that deal-making, ATT is sitting on more than $170 billion in debt. As part of the deal with Discovery, ATT will get $43 billion to help reduce its debt load. (The spun-off media business will begin its independent life with $58 billion in debt.)”

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/business/ATT-WarnerMedia-Discovery.html?referringSource=articleShare


The DealBook newsletter explains how ATT got here, in three key deals:

1..A $39 billion bid to buy T-Mobile. After regulatory pushback, in 2011 ATT walked away from an effort to become the country’s largest wireless company. T-Mobile paired up instead with Sprint, and the two went on to buy huge amounts of spectrum in the high-stakes battle for 5G, leaving ATT behind as it lobbies regulators to step in. The failed deal hit ATT with a $3 billion dollar breakup fee, at the time the largest ever.

2.  The $67 billion acquisition of DirectTV. In 2015, ATT bet on cable TV as a way to amass customers whom it could eventually convert to streaming. But DirectTV bled subscribers as customers cut the cord, and ATT unloaded a stake in the company last year to TPG that valued DirectTV at about a third of its acquisition price. The deal also cost ATT about $50 million in advisory fees, according to Refinitiv.

3.  The $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. In 2018, Mr. Stephenson called the deal a “perfect match,” but the combined group struggled to invest in its telecom business while also spending enough to compete with the entertainment specialists at Netflix and Disney. Three years later, ATT is now spinning off the company so it can (re)focus on its quest for 5G market share. ATT paid $94 million in advisory fees to put the two companies together and an estimated $61 million to split them apart.",Company News,,7,t3_nfl6c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nfl6c8/details_behind_atts_debt_cross_posted/,13,0.79,[1621369387.0]
Submission,neemc8,TWLO: What happens when SMS becomes obsolete?,lifeDNP,"Been doing some DD on TWLO and can't wrap my head around what to me seems like one of the key risks/bear scenarios, being the eventual decline/obsolescence of SMS. 

I believe in the bull thesis and think Jeff Lawson has an amazing vision for the business and potential to grow the business into a developer-led customer engagement business, but today, the core business is still being a communications API provider. 

TWLO generates 45% of its revenue currently from SMS, providing the API which is used by businesses to prove an array of services, marketing, notifications, updates and codes to name a few examples. 

Unlike voice or email which does not appear likely to be replaced, when you look at SMS, it's hard to see a world where SMS thrives over the various chat apps, given the limited functionality of SMS over the internet-based apps. The only advantage SMS has over an internet app is it its ubiquity and platform/device agnostic nature, which affords it a high degree of visibility and front-page status on most people's phone real estate. Part of this, I would argue, is also because old habits die hard and we all expect SMS when interacting with those outside of our social networks.

However, if the West goes the way of what is being seen in China, with the almost universal adoption of a singular chat app e.g. WeChat, we could see the use and value of SMS decline, as is being observed in China. 

Without solving for the complexity and obstacles in connecting internet devices to the legacy PSTN network, TWLO's value add is greatly diminished, and whilst they still provide API services for apps such as Whatsapp, FB etc, this relies on the communication being routed through TWLO as part of an omni-channel solution. If Whatsapp reaches out directly to the end customer through their platform, TWLO is not involved in that transaction. 

This also increases the reliance on big tech to allow TWLO to provide these services. 

On one hand, SMS usage in the near term is forecast to grow, and tools such as TWLO's APIs will unlock effective, powerful and hopefully two-engagement that benefits both business and customer. The use cases are just getting started. On the other hand, I can see a world where the pace of SMS obsolescence increases as we become saturated with marketing and often unwanted notifications, and we slowly migrate to different applications/platforms for our real communications, relegating the SMS app to the attic in our phones, only checking it occasionally when we know we are expecting something. This decline in eyeballs would then reduce the effectiveness of SMS for businesses and marketers, diverting these communications to a realm where TWLO has limited ability to monetise. 

I don't know if i'm just missing something or it's just me, I haven't read much debate/discussion on this when reading about TWLO so just curious on people's thoughts.",Company Discussion,,8,t3_neemc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/neemc8/twlo_what_happens_when_sms_becomes_obsolete/,16,0.84,[1621253649.0]

Submission,na1u4o,Nautilus Inc: Exposure to Connected Fitness at 7x earnings,WalterBoudreaux,"Nautilus is a leading global producer of home fitness equipment known for its Bowflex and Schwinn brands of connected fitness bikes, treadmills, ellipticals, and strength training equipment. The company is the 3rd largest player (by a large margin) in the fragmented connected fitness industry. The business, led by a new CEO, has executed on a transformational turnaround in its business model. It has shifted away from being a cyclical fitness equipment maker and towards becoming a high margin, subscription-oriented connected fitness company. The redesigned products have been selling extremely well, and the connected fitness subscription numbers are growing at triple digits (albeit from a small base). 

The company is valued at less than 1x sales, 7x earnings, and has 20% of its market cap in net cash on the balance sheet. The stock trades at over a 75% discount compared to public and private peers including Peloton, NordicTrack, Tonal, Tempo, and more.

Q1 numbers reported yesterday afternoon.

Excellent numbers and forward guidance confirms my viewpoint that the company has transformed its business, and at-home fitness is not going anywhere.  


I am also hopeful that they can capitalize on the fact that their treadmills aren't killing children and injuring adults (referencing the mess Peloton has found itself in).

  
**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights:**  


* $206.1 million revenue (+121% YoY) 
   * \+143.3% YoY excluding divested Octane Fitness commercial business (sold last October)
   * Blew past Q1 guidance of $145 million to $165 million (+55% to 75% YoY)
   * highest quarterly sales in 35-year company history
* $30.4 million net income (vs. $2.2 million Q1 2020)  

* $0.93 earnings per share (vs. $0.07 EPS Q1 2020). beat estimates by over 100%
* $100 million net cash on balance sheet (vs. $500 million market cap)
* 6x to 8x P/E
* $179 million in order backlogs at the end of March

**Apr-June 2021 Quarter Forward Guidance**  


* \+40% to +50% YoY sales growth (+51% to +62% excluding Octane Fitness), \~$170 million in revenue
* 250,000 JRNY subscribers by March 2022
* $12 million to $14 million annual CAPEX with majority earmarked for JRNY subscription service 

Blowout quarter that was even stronger than Q4 2020, which I believe most people suspected would be peak earnings for many ""pandemic winners.""  


The business itself has continued to perform extremely well. The majority of market participants have been extremely skeptical as to whether Nautilus was a one-hit pandemic winner. In contrast, all of my research indicated that at-home fitness was here to permanently stay for a large part of the population. Nautilus had also permanently transformed their product portfolio and business model (JRNY connected fitness service) to capture this growth in the market.

  
Q2 2021 is the first true ""pandemic YoY comp"" to gauge how the business will perform in a more normal world. The fact that Nautilus has guided to 40% to 50% YoY growth (and even higher excluding divested commercial business) means the company's ability to grow in the post-pandemic world is becoming clearly evident. The order backlog of $179 million (at the end of a $206 million sales quarter) is also indicative of this.

  
Margins and profitability will definitely be pressured for the next 1 to 2 quarters due to higher commodity prices, global chip shortages, and increased marketing and investment in JRNY. However, I don't see a particularly difficult path for them to hit $2.50 to $3.00 in EPS this year, which means the stock currently trades at around 6x to 8x earnings. 

  
This is quite cheap, especially considering that net cash is 20% of market cap, and the company is in the process of complementing its equipment business with predictable, high margin software revenue from the JRNY connected fitness subscription.

  
I have been frustrated that the market was not giving this company much credit over the last 9 months. But as they keep executing quarters like this, there's no way the stock can stay down here in a single digit P/E.",Company Analysis,,10,t3_na1u4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/na1u4o/nautilus_inc_exposure_to_connected_fitness_at_7x/,13,0.77,[1620752592.0]

Submission,nqw39t,My concerns about railroad stocks,financeasmr,"Recently, I saw a video on Vice about the issues with precision schedule railroading, a new trend that is meant to boost profits and efficiency for railroad companies.

The concern about this trend is that it has resulted in an increase in railroad derailments. This surge is caused by multiple factors as a part of this move to precision schedule railroading:

1. Inspectors have less time to inspect rail carts and even neglect to check some of them despite going over 35K miles (or even 90K miles) without inspection. Rail carts need to be inspected every 3,500 miles.

2. Workers are being overworked and underpaid and I worry it will cause more issues down the line

Please let me know what you think. I don’t see this as sustainable for the railroad industry. Thank you.",Industry Discussion,,22,t3_nqw39t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nqw39t/my_concerns_about_railroad_stocks/,14,0.89,[1622667257.0]
Submission,npxgbd,Facebook: A Bullish Analysis [Mix of Technical and Fundamental],y_angelov,"# Price

Facebook currently trades at around $330. Its latest support is at around $296 to $300 and its latest resistance is actually around $330 so essentially the price that it's trading for right now. This is a crucial moment. If it manages to break $330, then we can see an upward movement going up to $360 which is the high ceiling of this channel that it has started forming. If you haven't invested yet, it could be a good time to wait for a couple of days or a week to see how its price will evolve. I have a feeling that it will start consolidating or it could slowly drop down to $315 or, worst case scenario, $300. It is currently trading above its 50D MA and its Relative Strength Index is near the top, but the volume is relatively low which makes me think that we probably won't see a lot of movement in the next week or two. However, as I said, I think that there is a good chance that we can see Facebook hitting $360 in a few months and maybe even $400 by the end of the year. Why? Well, Facebook has been delivering great results after great results. The fundamental performance of the company has been amazing so far. Absolutely amazing! In fact, out of ALL of its 20 earnings reports since 2016, it has only missed 1 and that was by 1 cent and it has only missed revenue ***twice***! The company outperforms analyst expectations and by a big margin, especially in the last 4 quarters. Last quarter, it beat analyst earnings expectations by 41%! This is massive! Especially for a company of Facebook's size! Essentially, what we are seeing is the pandemic boost in advertising that Facebook received was not as transitory as analysts expected. Also, there has been nothing but upward revisions for Facebook's Full Year 2021 earnings, which is a very good sign. 39 upward revisions in total! There have also been 23 upward earnings revisions for next quarter's earnings, which is almost always a good sign. Also, out of the 51 analyst covering Facebook in May, 45 have had a Buy or a Strong Buy rating!

# The Business

However, let's leave analyst opinions aside for the moment. They are good to gauge Wall Street's appetite for the company, but let's look at the business, at the fundamentals. Is Facebook really a good company? Facebook's main source of revenue are the ***advertising revenues that*** come from ads on its products, the Facebook app and website, Instagram, Whatsapp and Messenger. By gathering user data, Facebook is able to offer targeted ads which are obviously more expensive, but are also more attractive to advertisers. Even though regulators have reduced the amount of data that Facebook can gather and therefore reduced its ability to target specific audiences through its ads, the company has still managed to grow its advertising business by a LOT! Another reason why the company has done so well is because it operates the 7th most website in the world, Facebook, which is also the 2nd most visited social media website behind YouTube. Instagram is extremely popular as well, ranking in the 23rd place! As of the latest quarter, the Daily active users of Facebook's family of products are 2.72 BILLION with the number of monthly active users being 3.45 BILLION or more than 10 times the population of the US! This is literally half of the world's population! Facebook is still seeing growth in user numbers with its total user base up 15% year-on-year which is actually faster than last year's increase of 11%. So, we can see that their user base is growing, but is that translating into higher revenues? The answer: yes! In 2020, Facebook reported a 20% year-on-year advertising revenue increase, but in their last quarter alone, the advertising revenue increase was 46% compared to last year! Advertising makes about 98% of Facebook's revenue so we can see that the company is getting a serious boost in overall profits. Their net income also grew by 58% in 2020 year-on-year and an astonishing 94% in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to last year! Essentially, we can see that Facebook is reporting some serious growth for a megacap company and it is largely due to the increase in their advertising business. However, Facebook are also involved in Virtual and Augmented Reality through their Reality Labs. While this side of Facebook is still tiny, it is reporting a serious growth in revenues as well. In the first quarter of 2021, its revenue grew by almost 150% as compared to last year and now makes up 2.7% of Facebook's revenue! VR and AR are still relatively young industries, but they are growing fast as we can see. Market researchers claim that the industry will grow at an annual rate of 42% from $37B in 2019 to an astonishing $1.27T in 2030! Facebook is one of the leaders in this space along with Apple, Microsoft and Samsung so this represents a massive opportunity for the tech giant and yet another solid bullish argument for Facebook. Unlike its competitors, Facebook's business is relatively concentrated so I think this gives the company a competitive advantage when it comes to growing its VR and AR business. The company has also grown its headcount by 30% in 2020 so we can see that it is doubling down on expansion and growth. Despite that, analysts are only expecting a revenue and earnings growth of about 15% annually for the next 3 years. To some extent, that is justified as Facebook did get a big bump in earnings due to COVID. However, I think that their estimates lean towards the conservative side and I think that Facebook can actually achieve a growth of between 20% and 25%, especially when we consider the VR and AR business. This may sound optimistic, but given Facebook's record of beating analyst estimates, I am okay with sounding optimistic. The only hurdle that Facebook may run into is regulation, which is always on the table for big tech companies like it. However, it has has a record of successfully dealing with regulation and continuing to deliver good results despite of it so I'll take my chances.

# The Balance Sheet

Now, you may be thinking, great, Facebook is positioned well for the future, but how are the fundamentals looking right now? We can see they are growing, but can they support that growth? Personally, I think so. Facebook has a tremendous balance sheet and a massive stockpile of cash and cash equivalents. They currently have just over $64B as of 31th March 2021 which represents a $2-2.5B increase from the end of December 2020 and an increase of almost $10B since December 2019. The huge cash positions means that Facebook has enough capital to expand without being worried about financing, it means that it can buy new companies to help its expansion or to prevent competition, but most importantly, it means that the company is doing well. We can also see that in the company's share repurchase program. Facebook has repurchased $6.3B of shares in 2020 and $4.2B of shares in 2019 and, in January 2021, it authorized an additional $25B of stock repurchases so the total right now is about $34B. This doesn't mean that they will repurchase all $34B, but that they can. Still, the fact that they have authorized that programme is a positive sign. In addition to their massive stockpile of cash, Facebook only has liabilities of $30B or less than half the size of its cash stockpile. What does that mean? It means that Facebook is healthy and it's taking its vitamins. The company is solid and is more than able to tackle any short- or medium-term challenges to its business. It has no long-term debt, meaning that if they do decide to borrow money, they will be able to do so at much better rates than some of its rivals.

# The Ratios

Then, if we look at some the fundamental ratios, we can see that Facebook is. A. Beast! Their Return-on-Assets is 20.3% compared to the industry's average of 10.3% and their Return-on-Equity was 25.3% last year! Lets compare it to its rivals. I think that the companies closest to Facebook in terms of business are Twitter, Google, and Snapchat although Snap is in very early stages of growth. In terms of ROA and ROE, both Snapchat and Twitter are negative so there's not much point in comparing them, but Google has a 15.3% ROA. Their ROE is also lower at 22.3% as opposed to Facebook's 25.3%. Now, Facebook's forward Price-to-earnings ration is only 21.6 whereas Google has 25.5, Twitter's is 52.4 and Snapchat has a Forward PE of 92, so again, Facebook turns out to be the best price for its projected earnings. In terms of current PE, Facebook has 28.2, Google has 32.2 and Snapchat and Twitter don't have one because they are unprofitable. The current S&P average PE is 37.2 so we can see that both Facebook and Google are under the market average although Facebook is again cheaper. What these ratios tell us is that Facebook is not only operating a very efficient business, but it's also at a very good price relative to its peers. Even looking at it historically, Facebook has rarely dropped below a PE of 27-28 so the current price is, again, excellent and cheap. This is my own opinion, feel free to do your own research, but according to my personal EPS growth we can expect a roughly 12% annual return on Facebook over the next 10 years if we buy it at $330. That is assuming a 15% earnings growth next year which will taper off and assuming that we can sell it at a PE ratio of around 30-32. If the earnings grow at around 20% next year, then we can look at a roughly 15% annual return which is higher than the average return of the S&P 500, meaning that Facebook is likely to beat the market, at least in my opinion.

Submission,np641d,Quick glance at VZIO,cokehole," 

Vizio is an American company founded in Orange County California in 2002. It focuses on producing smart televisions, sound bars, and accessories.It also operates Platform+ that comprises SmartCast, a Smart TV operating system, enabling a fully integrated home entertainment solution, and data intelligence and services products through Inscape. Its SmartCast delivers content and applications through an easy-to-use interface, as well as supports streaming apps and hosts its free ad-supported video app, WatchFree, as well as VIZIO Free Channels. In addition, the company provides support for third-party voice platforms.

Sector: Consumer Goods/Electronics

Vizio went public 03/25/2021 at 21$ since then it ranged from $17.25-$28.80 and currently sits at $21.84.

Market cap of $4B with 2020 sales of $2.04B and a P/E ratio of 40.

Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million. With a forecasted annual earnings increase of 46.9%

Vizio has no debt compared to 5 years ago when its debt to equity ratio was 89.4%.

Short term assets ($750.8M) exceed its short term liabilities ($523.4M).

Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million 

Net income declined 64% year over year to $3.3 million. (Vizio attributes this to problems with importing goods during the pandemic)   

SmartCast Active Accounts grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million 

One potential issue is Smartcast is only 3 years old and is not as well known as Roku, Amazon firestick or apple tv. People could opt for what the know rather than give smartcast a shot.

Vizio has strong financials and is focusing more on the ad revenue generated by smartcast. I don’t have much stake in Vizio but I do see potential. With some volume this stock can move.",,,8,t3_np641d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/np641d/quick_glance_at_vzio/,14,0.79,[1622475183.0]

Submission,nir9b6,$CWH Camping World Holdings DD & Analysis,Ideaambiguousawhole,"A bit of research of one of my newer positions of my portfolio. Take all of this with a grain of salt. I am not a financial professional. I'm barely a Finance student (but I will be this Summer), Graduated with an International Business degree, and decided to double major and get a degree in Finance from 2021-2022 for personal reasons mostly. Having said that, here is my Bull Case for Camping World Holdings:

Overview: Camping World Holdings benefited in both the short and long term from the pandemic due to the lockdown creating a larger market for it's signature products, RV's, camping supplies, and other outdoor recreational products. With two consecutive years of warm seasonal pandemic swings occuring, Camping World Holdings has been in the position to capitalize and increase its Earnings Per Share drastically over the last 2 years. Despite this, the stock is still trading at a PE ratio of 8.47, despite its recent wave of earnings justifying a price of over twice it's current price of 40, as it's 5 year average justifies the stock trading at a PE Ratio of 20.47. With another pandemic summer occurring with another round of stimulus checks in many people's pockets, and with potential post-pandemic economic growth, CWH is in a position to benefit from it's recent growth and continue to deliver strong earnings into the next few years. CWH is also starting to emerge as a sneaky dividend stock, as it has recently increased its quarter dividend from .23 a share to .25 and has a current dividend yield of  2.5%, which is above average in its industry. 

Pros:

Trades at a very attractive valuation currently: It's currently trading at a PE ratio of 8.47. Over the last 5 years it's Earnings have been consistent with a PE ratio of 20.47. At it's current share price of just under 40 dollars a share, this stock is very undervalued in my opinion as both a growth and a value stock. 

Starting to emerge as a dividend stock: The market median for a dividend stock in its industry is a yield of 2.28%. With CWH's recent dividend hike, their yield is reasonably above this median at 2.5% and is likely to grow higher in the future. 

Q2 Hype: CWH is set to report 2nd Quarter earnings on the 3rd of August, a good bit of time from now, but it has high expectations to live up to. The current Low/High ranges between 8 Analysts range from 1.77 to 2.65 per share. Having said that, there's no reason to think that CWH won't deliver. It beat it's Q1 estimate average of .70 by 1.40 a share, and the upcoming hot weather mixed with pent up stimulus spending is likely to help this company into the next Quarter. Regardless of the Earnings outcome, hype around this quarter is likely to drive up the price as the earnings date comes closer due to speculation. 

Cons:

Traits of a Cyclical Stock: CWH runs the risks of other stocks with cyclical traits. While I believe there is enough short term substance to pent up stimulus spending and access to cheap debt to justify a short to medium term recommendation, for long-term investors the stock may be prone to cyclical downfalls.  Seeing as a large part of their revenue stream is RV repairs, and current RV sales growth will mean more RV repairs down the road, I think the cyclical nature will somewhat even out. 

High Q2 Expectations Mean High Volatility Risk: If the stock fails to deliver relative to what's priced in during Q2 earnings, the stock might take a dive. Anyone who may need this money within the next few months might not want to deal with the potential volatility. 

Conclusion:

I believe Camping World Holdings is great as both a Value and a Growth stock and has the potential to be a strong performer for years to come. Already trading at a great valuation and poised to benefit from a post-pandemic economy with extra stimulus money to be spent, I believe this is a great stock to own at it's current price point, and to pick up during a dip for any medium to long term value/growth investor.",,,17,t3_nir9b6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nir9b6/cwh_camping_world_holdings_dd_analysis/,15,0.86,[1621715071.0]

Submission,ndmxwe,The Weekly DD - AT&T (T): A Bond Proxy,TheStonksHub,"What if I told you there was a stock that offers a \~6-7% dividend AND has potential for revenue growth, is that something you would be interested in? That company is AT&T (T) and we’ll break-down some opportunities & challenges this cash-generating machine faces in the mid-to-long term.

**The Overview**

AT&T has three business segments: Communications, Warner Media, and Latin America. AT&T’s communications segment contributes \~79% of operating revenues and \~80% of profits. AT&T’s recent acquisition of Warner Media adds to AT&T’s development, production, and distribution capabilities. The Warner Media acquisition has been broadly successful, comprising 17% of AT&T’s revenues and 22% of profits. Warner Bros. is one of the largest TV and film studios globally, remains a media powerhouse with a profound content library that reaches audiences across many platforms.

In this day and age huge “value” is seen in the amount of users or customers a company has reached. A quick glance at Zoom and we can see that a large portion of their value comes from the 300 million users they leverage. Coming back to AT&T they have over 170 million customers across numerous products to go along with a broad array of content rights.

**HBO Max**

One of AT&T’s biggest risks over the next 5 years comes from their acquisition of HBO Max. Main concerns are over whether or not they can retain or grow the service’s subscriber base and ultimately increase earnings. Management has recently [**increased expectations**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/at-t-raises-hbo-max-target-to-as-many-as-150-million-subscribers#:~:text=AT&T%20Inc.,key%20to%20the%20company) of the HBO Max subscription base to reach between 120 to 150 million subscribers by 2025, which is up from their relatively conservative estimate of 75-90 million in 2019. Here’s a look from their recent earnings presentation  

AT&T is progressing in its postpaid wireless, and HBO Max segments, which saw \~800k lines and an additional **\~3.5M subscribers added in their previous two quarters**. Consumers are willing to spend more on high-quality internet service as work from home continues.

**Final Thoughts**

When we look at AT&T’s share price over the last 10 years and we see the stock is up roughly 10% during that time-period it doesn’t necessarily instill confidence as a profitable investment. Some might argue why purchasing shares of AT&T would be a better investment than a “more secure” bond play. However, it is our opinion that AT&T is at a turning point and we may now be able to see the best of both worlds, a high yield dividend return, as well as steady growth in revenues.

A 5% return per annum, paired with its high dividend yield of \~6-7%, allows AT&T to remain more attractive than treasury bonds even with the associated risk of holding shares. Despite increased debt levels and decreased credit ratings, AT&T has a strong strategy to reduce its debt burden. AT&T should continue to have a dividend payout ratio at roughly 50% of FCF, acting as a bond proxy in an investor’s portfolio.

Submission,n9680h,DD: $IRBT - The Dust Has Settled,F1rstxLas7,"**Note:** Before reading, consider if I'm worth my salt. Here's an overview of my performance since I started posting Stock Analysis to reddit: https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7. Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them, so why shouldn't we do the same on reddit?

**Intro:** iRobot = Roomba, got it? It's really that simple. It's a household name brand that sells their robot vacuums, as well as automatic floor mopping robots, a robot that teaches kids to code(this speaks directly to my heart), and their new robotic lawn mower. Incorporated in 1990, Headquartered in Massachusetts, blah, blah, blah. 

**Bear case:** Yeah, we're going to do this analysis a little differently. 

There have been a few good threads examining IRBT, most of which have the same few comments and criticisms. 

1. ""There are so many low cost alternatives to the Roomba, iRobot has no chance at maintaining market leadership."" This isn't wrong, only... it kind of is. iRobot has been stating this for literally *years* in their 10Ks. They know it exists. There *are* low cost alternatives that reduce the quality vs price trade-off, but this does 2 things:
 * Creates a race to the bottom effect between low cost manufacturers thus competition grows between *them* just to survive. This reduces overall profitability of low cost brands and removes them from the market sooner.
 * Hurts the robovac industry *short term* as people purchase these low quality products, realize they're not super effective, and decide to just stick with a regular vacuum in the future. 

2. ""IRBT has failed to capitalize on their technology or to expand."" First of all, they lead the market in their technology and I don't mean ahead of the aforementioned discount brands, I mean against Samsung, Shark, and other major players in the household cleaning industry that have been established *for years.* They are specialists, through and through. Their process is slow and deliberate and that's *exactly* why they'll maintain their market edge. Admittedly, this is exactly what frustrates investors- the lack of perceived growth in a time when every other tech-centric consumer good is gaining momentum- and I love iRobot for this.

3.    ""IRBT stock price hasn't really moved much."" If you're investing based on stock price movement, you're not investing at all. But since I know that's not helpful, fine, the price has about tripled in the last 5 years.

Alright, I admit that the above Bear case was only used to illustrate some rebuttals to common arguments against IRBT. It's important to consider that just because I disagree with the arguments above, doesn't mean that the rest of the market does as well. Public sentiment is always a factor when considering investments and I realize that right now I'm betting against the above arguments. Below, I will get further into some of my subjective analysis that further defends this thesis.

**Metrics:**

1. **P/E** of 16. I know, everyone is hating on the P/E ratio lately, but it's still a valuable indicator of a company's performance whether we like it or not. Ok, so a P/E of 16 is reasonable at least, especially considering today's current max market P/E or Sharpe ratio. But that's not even why I'm mentioning it. If we exclude last year's COVID crisis effect on the market, iRobot's P/E ratio has *never* ***ever*** been this low. Now that's not to say it can't go lower, but I don't think I've ever seen a strong, high functioning company been as undervalued compared to itself as iRobot is right now. (MacroTrends)
2. **PEG ratio**, as a result of the above, is an absurd .89 if dividing P/E by the projected next 5 years of earnings growth. What's great about this is that that's *a low end estimate* for earnings growth. IRBT saw an earnings growth of 73% over the TTM, is projected for a 62% EPS growth over the coming year, and even their past 5 years show a 28.5% EPS growth. Dividing the P/E by any of those numbers makes the undervaluation theory *even stronger*. It's absurd how undervalued this is right now. (Finviz)
3. **Debt:** Zero debt, but I did want to mention this for a specific reason. When a company lacks *any* debt, it's perceived that growth is limited if financial leverage isn't being used. This is understandable, but I think that iRobot has found a middle ground between funding new projects with their own cash and maintaining a ridiculously healthy balance sheet.
4. **Other Basics:** Revenue, gross revenue, and Cash Flow from Operations has continued to climb steadily year after year. Their product lineup might not be growing, but they sure as Heck are growing stronger financially over time. Also, their entire cash position outweighs their entire Liabilities column on the Balance Sheet- how can you not love that?

5. **Institutional Ownership** is 100%. There's no real room here. This shows confidence in the company, but prevents major moves upward by a new, big interested buyer to jump the price significantly. It also brings along the potential risk of a major move down if an Institution decides it wants to pull out. What compounds this issue is that there's only about 28 million shares of iRobot to go around and while they have issued buybacks to reduce this amount, which is good for investors, it can also be very scary during tumultuous times. 

**Subjective analysis:** I love but had the concern going into this that the company hasn't ""grown"" in a few years. After looking through their financial statements, I've been proven wrong. As a matter of fact, they've proven me wrong time and time again when trying to find cracks in the armor. I was hoping that perception of their product lineup was poor- it's not. Even with Samsung being in the same market as them since 2014, Roomba has *crushed* their competition and it's partly because the customer base believes in them. I then turned my attention to employee sentiment -that too was a dead end. Glassdoor shows raves reviews for iRobot. People like working there.

Warren Buffett has said(yes, I know, the entirety of reddit quotes him but today this is extra applicable to this thesis) that there might be a thousand people who don't agree with your investing opinion- and that's fine. As it stands now, I don't think many people perceive iRobot as a company with the growth momentum of a rocket ship. Putting myself in the perspective of a business owner, which is what you become the moment you hit the 'Place Buy Order' button, has made me realize that I would love to own this business. It's a profitable leader in a market segment that has the *ability* to expand further into the quickly growing tech and robotics industries, but doesn't *rely* on them. So if the haters hate then let them hate, and watch the money pile up.

Submission,n80bm5,Short Term and Long term Play for Container Shipping Industry,i_am_mr_blue," 

**Container shipping industry has grown tremendously in last 12 months. Companies like DAC, ZIM, NMM are very cheap after the huge growth, P/E< 10. I believe there is still 50-100% upside in short term (5-6 months). The following DD I took from WSB written by** [u/c12mintz](https://www.reddit.com/u/c12mintz/) **(5 weeks prior). I hold positions in the aforementioned companies and long for them**. **I removed some part of the post as it violates** r/stocks **rules.**

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I’m currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM).

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021.

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+.

I believe we’re probably 4th or 5th inning here. For my disclosure, I’m \*still\* very long nearly all the key names in the space- $ATCO $CPLP $DAC $MPCC (Oslo) $NMM and $ZIM.

Submission,nna2po,Dividends and why I’m long on them. From a “Young Investor’s” POV,xLilTragicx,"Let me preface this with I’m new and still don’t fully grasp what I’m talking about completely. Don’t take my advice, do your own DD. 

Hi my usual online alias is Tragic, why? Who cares. 

I’m a 23 year old male living in the US. I have 0 secondary education however I have picked up trades in my jobs. (Welding, Soldering, Construction) I wasn’t fortunate enough to be born into a family with money. In fact I grew up thinking butter on toast was what everyone ate for breakfast and lunch and that stew was the “standard” dinner. 

Once I moved out and got a job I didn’t, still don’t, have kids and enjoyed eating food.... a lot. Well I started realizing I don’t have any money to save up. I was living paycheck to paycheck. After a while I started getting frustrated that I can’t do anything I “wanted” to do, but a nice car, a house, go on a real vacation. Still can’t do most of those however I’m not truly struggling. I have a savings now and I understand the risks of the stock market don’t put in what you’re not willing to lose and any company can fail. It just take one “Oh Fudge” moment. 

I’m not gonna lie and say I’ve been doing this forever. I started paying attention to the stock market during the GME craze. Never bought in an gladly so. I woulda been at the 300$ range if I tried and there was already to much risk so I wasn’t chancing it. But it got me thinking. I have my emergency money saved up why can’t I use stocks as a savings plan? Kinda...

The way I look at dividend yielding stocks is pretty simplistic. One share of T is roughly 30$ and has a quarterly payout of 52¢. Which means it’ll take 14 years for that 1 stock to pay itself back. If I invest monthly into multiple assets that pay dividends and take that set of income and reinvest it then it’ll start acting like compounding my savings account. 

I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this. 

It’s not a short plan but it’s one I feel confident in, and if the stocks appreciate in value then I’ll be even happier! Thanks for reading!

Figuring now though that a straight ETF without the direct dividens would be better especially given the long term as it's looking at 15 years+ before any withdrawals will happen.  I did toss some trailing stops on the stocks minus QYLD at 15% so if the market does have a major drop like when covid hit it will exit before losing significant value.

I've bought 10 shares at various price points and my total cost was $1810. So a $181/share cost average. 

• I sold 5 of my shares when the price hit $186.

• My remaining 5 shares in the market showed a new ""cost"" of $1190 which didn't make any sense to me. I expected the new cost to be $880 -- Cost of $1810 - \[5 shares\]\*\[$186 sell price\] = $880. 

• I then bought 5 shares back when the price hit $178 leaving $40 in my cash account. 

• My new cost is $2080 for all 10 shares. So a $208/share cost average.    


I don't understand how I SOLD 5 shares ABOVE my cost/share average and then bought back in BELOW my cost/share average and my cost/share average went UP.

Submission,niq4dv,How to actively manage a watchlist and information?,HalfEpic,"Hi all, I’m hoping I can get some advice on how to actively manage my stock watchlist. Without getting to deep, I am primarily a US stock swing trader with a small (~5k) portfolio, though I also invest a good portion of my $$ into ETFs & lower risk/reward funds. I work part time and it’s lucrative enough to pay the bills and give me a bit of extra $$ to invest. 

I’ve been splitting my spare time between learning and trading. My strategy up to this point has been creating a spreadsheet of ~120 companies who’s charts I check every 1-3 days (depending on momentum of the trend), and never go longer than 2 weeks without checking a company’s chart. I spend 4-5 hours on weekdays reading charts & news, and journaling my arguments as to which way companies will move.

 However, I am starting to get a bit burnt out because I am constantly seeing new tickers, news, and significant movement within different market sectors. I am having trouble connecting all the dots and organizing information for the companies in my watchlist. I believe they all have merit, but I am getting overwhelmed trying to keep track of all the moving parts within. Right now, I use TD to trade & paper play, TradingView to chart and journal, Excel to keep track of my watchlists & when to check. I also use website like the S&P heat map, an economic calendar, and greed/fear gauge for news & overall market observation. I also use a trading discord but only listen to people I know are informed & reliable. 

I guess I feel overwhelmed by my strategy’s time frame / deadlines and the amount of potentially pertinent information I receive. I’d be grateful to hear from anyone with similar experience or understanding that could offer any tips, tricks, or advice in general.",Advice Request,,11,t3_niq4dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/niq4dv/how_to_actively_manage_a_watchlist_and_information/,12,0.79,[1621711736.0]

I'm newish to investing. I'm 33 and have a general question about the recent massive influx of printed money and how that might affect stock prices going forward. Actually unrelated to that, I wonder, what is your opinion on this bull market ending and crashing hard? To the contrary, my mind is thinking that, in theory, isn't every stock undervalued right now due to the recent 4trillion in printed money, or have we seen the market respond accurately to that already?

If not, isn't it a no-brainer to invest in some top stocks in each sector? I'm starting to see prices everywhere start to slowly creep up in everyday life (fast food is insanely expensive now). I hear companies like BOA increasing their minimum hourly wage to $25 by 2025. I see Chipotle, Target and other companies like Amazon paying between 15-17 an hour for basic work.

Again, wouldn't this mean the current prices we're seeing in the stock market are technically ""undervalued"" and not accurate meaning they should all go up significantly in the next year, 2 or 5? Or will we see a sideways or bear market in the coming years?

I understand this is a broad generalization I'm making, but would like to get some more seasoned advice around the general theme I'm presenting. Thanks for reading.

Submission,ndyees,The cleanest re-open play left - Simon Properties,TribalTrading," Starting in early fall last year, I kept questioning many of my recovery-related positions as having already had their run. As weeks and months went by, stocks in those industries kept increasing - airlines, cruises, casinos, et al. Come February, I wanted to find more recovery plays and landed on one of my better trades of the last few months - call options on Live Nation ($LYV). In the last few weeks I wanted to do more digging as I questioned that maybe there's something left as a recovery play. I ran across $SPG, Simon Properties Group.

I believe SPG is a great pick as it has big upside potential for a large cap stock (40bn market cap), with minimal downside risk. Being mostly an investor/owner of malls (the largest in the nation), and mall-like real estate, the stock was obviously shot down at the start of the pandemic last year. It has recovered since but not to pre-Covid levels and far from all time highs of $229 (currently at $122).  


The stock offers a nice dividend to top it all off, the only time it diluted is when it made some acquisitions for basically pennies on the dollar at the height of the pandemic (great moves), and run by good management.   They’ve even kept paying the dividend, paying it out every quarter still, with Q1 2020 being the sole exception, when everything was closed.  Profitable, low PE, dividend, and growth all in one.  *A true hidden gem!*",Trades,,10,t3_ndyees,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ndyees/the_cleanest_reopen_play_left_simon_properties/,15,0.82,[1621200375.0]

Submission,nbxor9,"Analyst forecasts of 109 million Disney+ forecast subscribers was a guaranteed miss, and its stupid they forecasted it",isitdonethen,"For Q1 results, as of January 2, 2021, Disney stated they had 94 million subscribers.

During the annual shareholders meeting on March 9, Disney announced 100 million D+ subscribers.

Q2 ended April 3. Disney reports 103.6 million D+ subscribers. This growth of 3.6 million over a month is pretty on pace with the 3 million per month between January and March.

The average forecast from analysts was 109 million D+ subscribers. Are these analysts completely ignoring data provided directly by Disney? This estimate miss is by far the biggest narrative from Disney's earnings and is in every headline. I don’t get how they can be so off, and the market selling off in response. 

I can only assume these analysts looked at Q4 2020 to Q1 2020 (73.7 to 94 million subscribers) and based something off that. But analysts not only should know better, they do. I researched bearish analysts on Disney after their Q1 results, and they were all aware this large bump for Q1 came from Disney’s purchasing of Hotstar in India. So a growth of 20+ million per quarter, per analyst knowledge, shouldn’t have been typical. 

I’m sure the answer is that analysts and the market can be quite dumb.

EV does not even consider the assets bought by the company. So I'm not understanding why it's more of an accurate value of a company. When it only includes Market Cap and debts - Cash.

Book Value= Total Assets - Liabilities

Submission,n8i6vl,"BIGC earnings on May 11, could see a recovery from recent slide",radarbot,"BIGC is an e-commerce company that competes with SHOP. The difference between BIGC and SHOP is that BIGC targets large companies and is more focused on customization of their shop front.

BIGC has recently been clobbered by the tech company bear market, seeing a price slide to ATL, well below its IPO opening price. The IPO was priced at $25, BIGC started trading at $80, and after some peaks to $120, its been on a slide consistently down where it has now settled at $48. So really, $25 --> $48 in the ultra-realitic case.

BIGC saw a small jump in its price after releasing its earnings on February 26, but returned back to its slide since then. https://investors.bigcommerce.com/node/7361/html#ITEM_8_FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS_SUPPLEMENTAR

In 2020, they saw 45% profit growth over 2019, which is a big jump from 2018-->2019.

At their current price point, they have a P/S of 21, which is on the low end for a tech e-comm company, especially since the comparisons to SHOP are direct. SHOP comparatively is at a PS of 40.

Now, here's the interesting risk/reward part. BIGC is trading at a level where a strong revenue beat, and projections of 50% revenue growth YoY could drive up the stock price with a 50% upside potential. Here's my logic:

Current P/S is 21 with a current revenue of $152M in 2020. Growth from 2019 to 2020 was 50%. So right now, it seems that revenue growth has not been factored into the price yet, and BIGC is in undervalued territory. If BIGC sees revenue in Q1 of $55M, that means they're on track to hit $220M for 2021, which is 50% revenue growth from 2020 to 2021. If that happens, BIGC now enters a trajectory to justify BOTH a higher multiplier (like SHOP) and a price increase based on the current multiplier.

BUT, here's the risk part. If BIGC misses revenue, and only gets revenue of $40M, I expect its stock to crash all the way to $25. BIGC is at ATL, and the only support below its current price is at $25 which was the IPO price. So the downside right now is 50% loss vs 50% gain. It almost feels like a blackjack hand.

Its also important to note that BIGC missed revenue in Q4 by 10%, coming in at $32M instead of $38M estimate. So maybe the dreams of a $55M quarter may be aspirational.",Company Discussion,,7,t3_n8i6vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n8i6vl/bigc_earnings_on_may_11_could_see_a_recovery_from/,12,0.79,[1620579058.0]
Submission,n82716,Buying overvalued stocks.,shortyafter,"Just want to get some experience and opinions here.  Obviously we should avoid overvalued stocks, because best case scenario there's not so much room to run, and worst case scenario they can actually plummet.  By overvalued I mean when the market value of the stock exceeds its intrinsic value, which can be calculated in different ways.  I find both [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) and [macroaxis.com](https://macroaxis.com) useful for a quick, automated reading.  I also understand that you can calculate it by hand, which I don't thanks to the wide variety of resources and analysts out there.

Anyway, I think most people would agree that the market is pretty high right now.  Are there deals to be had?  For sure!  And I think if you can find them, then that's obviously the best option.

But what do you guys think about buying a company that is slightly overvalued according to traditional metrics?  I'm not talking about Tesla here.  I'm talking about a blue-chip stock that may be trading 5-15% over what's considered fair.

Arguments against: it's a bad deal.

Arguments for: it may have more room to run, and time in the market beats timing the market.  If it's a good company you'll eventually recoup the initial investment and make gains even if it takes a bit longer.

Also keep in mind that I'm a small-time retail investor, as I'm sure many of us are.  Let's imagine I want to invest $1000 and I find a company with a fair value of $90, but it's trading at $100 currently.  I decide to go ahead and buy it, which would mean I'm paying a $100 premium for 10 shares of that company.

Is $100 really a big deal?  Again, as long as it's a good company with realistic prospects for growth, then sooner or later the stock's intrinsic value will surpass the market value.  You're out $100 that you could have invested in better value, but at the same time you've locked yourself in to a good company with good long-term growth prospects.

If it were a $100,000 investment, of course, you have a bigger issue.  Percentage wise it's the same, but I think you could argue that an extra $100 isn't really worth splitting hairs about.  $10,000 might be.

I also considered that you could balance out overvalued companies with undervalued ones.  Instead of buying 10 overvalued companies, which start to add up, you could lock yourself into 5 high-conviction overvalued companies, and balance them out with 5 undervalued plays to net a fair purchase value.

What do you guys think?  Do you buy overvalued companies, or do you do all that you can to avoid them?",,,51,t3_n82716,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n82716/buying_overvalued_stocks/,14,0.78,[1620519632.0]

Quite honestly this seems like a massive overreaction. Don’t see a massive risk here as their bikes are the major driver of their business. Even pricing in a few lawsuits and costs related to the recall, I don’t think a 15% dip was justified. 

Basic math/logic above coupled with the fact that everyone I know who has a peloton bike is absolutely obsessed with it lead me to scoop up some shares around $83 this week.

All, 

Context: I’m looking for a much smarter person than I that can explain what the hell just happened with $WKHS. This could be manipulation or a typical market approach by a bigger player but I just don’t know. I am hoping someone here can provide some context. I had pictures but those are not allowed here.

$WKHS had a great run-up from June 2020 to early February 2021. A variety of factors here, but EV/possible USPS contract/new delivery methods all played a role. Since then, it has been smashed down (peak at $40 down to $7ish):

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/)

There is some news here that led to the sell-off:

Workhorse Sinks 52% in Two Days After Losing USPS Award

Anyway, after being crushed down and watching the chart for the last 6 months, WKHS had a massive spike on June 3rd, yesterday:

(had pic but refer to chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/))

Media would tell you that spike was due to meme stock status (I had not seen WKHS on much of Reddit at all):

(had pic but can see the results here): [https://www.google.com/search?q=wkhs+stock&client=firefox-b-1-d&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLjbnx5\_7wAhUbHc0KHVAbASwQ\_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=2208&bih=1079](https://www.google.com/search?q=wkhs+stock&client=firefox-b-1-d&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLjbnx5_7wAhUbHc0KHVAbASwQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=2208&bih=1079)

There are other articles about meme $WKHS from Bloomberg, Motley, and The Street as well if you want to check for yourself. That made me suspicious. I’d been watching this ticker for a while and there was no movement around $WKHS – unless I really did miss that?

Now, today, June 4th, we are already seeing the media change their narrative as $WKHS begins what I assume will be a hard drop:

That seems to be quite the rug pull, no? I kept digging and this is where I was hoping to get some clarification. I can view limited details on holdings through whalewisdom. I wanted to check $WKHS and found two rather large call/put bets placed by Susquehanna and Citadel:

My father (a retired antique dealer) has tasked me with figuring out whether a collection of old stock certificates have any negotiable value.

But before I research the individual certificates, I need to know whether he could even legally claim any possible $ the stocks might be worth. According to pretty much every source I’ve read, you need proof of ownership or family connection to claim and endorse a certificate. But from what I can tell all those sources were referring to certificates that were never signed/endorsed by the original owner (which is typically the case when people find old stock certificates).

But what if the person who owned the stock already SIGNED/ENDORESED IT on the back? That’s the question I can’t find a definitive answer to. Of the many old stock certificates my father got in various auctions and other lots of old paper and antiques over several decades, a couple dozen were actually endorsed on the back and never canceled.

Submission,nlw1q0,"CDC approves first cruise ship to resume US operations, starting June 26",deevee12,"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article251706998.html

Federal health officials have approved the first passenger cruise from the U.S. from Fort Lauderdale in June — but Florida’s governor insists he will block company plans to require passengers be vaccinated.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday gave Royal Caribbean Group approval to start seven-night cruises to the Caribbean on its Celebrity Cruises brand ship, Celebrity Edge, on June 26, according to a CDC spokesperson. The ship is the first to win CDC approval for revenue cruises since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

The approval is a welcome milestone for the cruise industry, which has been paralyzed in the U.S. since March 2020 after COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths on several ships.

“For the past 15 months our conversations with friends and loved ones about seeing the world have been accompanied by the phrase ‘someday.’ I’m beyond proud and excited to say that day has arrived,” said Celebrity Cruises CEO Lisa Lutoff-Perlo in a statement. The June 26 cruise will leave from Port Everglades and visit Mexico and The Bahamas.

The CDC recommends all cruise passengers be vaccinated, but doesn’t require it. The agency has given cruise companies two options: meet vaccination thresholds of 98% of crew and 95% of passengers on the ship and start revenue cruises immediately, or forego the thresholds and first perform test cruises to ensure COVID protocols are working. Cruise ships that meet the threshold will have more relaxed mask and social distancing rules.

Celebrity Cruises spokesperson Susan Lomax said the company has opted to comply with the CDC’s vaccination threshold and will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated. The age requirement will drop to 12 years old on Aug. 1.

The go-ahead for Celebrity Cruises follows the CDC’s approval — also the first of its kind — of test cruises with volunteer passengers aboard Royal Caribbean International’s Freedom of the Seas ship from PortMiami in late June. Freedom of the Seas will require all crew and passengers 16 years old and older to be vaccinated, but will not meet the agency’s vaccination thresholds — meaning it must first perform test cruises before revenue cruises can begin.

Royal Caribbean Group is the second largest cruise company in the world with three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea.

The restart plans clash with a law recently passed by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and promoted by Gov. Ron DeSantis that bars businesses, schools and government entities across Florida from asking anyone to provide proof of a COVID-19 vaccination. Under the new law, which takes effect on July 1, businesses can be fined up to $5,000 per violation. The only exemption in the law is for licensed healthcare providers.

“We’ve been very clear, the law is clear in Florida,” said Taryn Fenske, spokesperson for the governor. “You can’t mandate vaccine passports. We are interested to see how the CDC works with them so that they don’t get these exorbitant fines.”

Celebrity plans to restart its cruises days before the new law takes effect. Lomax said the logistics of its vaccine requirement are still being worked out.

“We are working with the Governor’s office to align on the path forward,” she said via email.

DeSantis sued the CDC last month, asking a judge to force the agency to drop its cruise safety requirements and allow cruises to begin immediately. The judge instead sent the case to mediation, which begins Thursday.

Wednesday’s approval signals long-sought relief for the cruise industry, which first began working with the CDC to restart cruises last October under a conditional sail order issued by the agency. Cruise companies had to enhance COVID-19 testing capabilities on their ships, report weekly crew test results to the agency and secure agreements with ports and local health authorities in the cities they plan to visit.

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)** 

***These numbers were for ending March 31st and does not Include the following!!!***

**4/1/2021 EZGO reports a large order from the Ukraine the stock spikes to 9.48!** **These bikes are to be delivered in April!**

**4/15/2021 EZGO signs a new contract for 10,000 Bikes after an exhibition displaying their bikes**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales………which is 100% growth again……. I believe that estimate is light!

Submission,nk4e0k,Can someone explain the inflation worry when the banks have excess liquidity?,TreeHugChamp,"If banks have an excess amount of liquidity and the fed is trying to get people to spend money, why would the fed raise interest rates and make it more beneficial for people to hold onto their money? To me it only makes sense to drop interest rates to the negatives so people are forced to spend money or lose it. People aren’t going to spend money when commodity prices are high, so deflation would also prove to be beneficial for the economy IMO.        

How does increased interest rates cause more spending when all it does is cause commodities to go up and force more people to spend significantly less? Negative interest rates are also something that will boost retail growth as retail businesses will be able to borrow money at a negative rate and pay their employees a higher wage to get their business started/back running.       

If I’m not mistaken, back when Europe was in a negative rate environment, didnt Powell say he would consider negative rates when America is trying to reopen?       

Can someone ELI5 it for me? What exactly am I missing and what was the historical trend it follows outside of a Black Friday crash and 1970s inflation? “If” something extreme weren’t going to happen, what do you think would be the most likely outcome?",Industry Question,,18,t3_nk4e0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nk4e0k/can_someone_explain_the_inflation_worry_when_the/,12,0.8,[1621880061.0]

Submission,ng58hg,Performant Financial (PFMT) - The Facts,SirPrecision,"On May 13 the company reported earnings. The stock reaction has been muted due to low volume. The intense volatility in the name has slowed, as a FEW sophisticated  investors have accumulated meaningful starter positions (emphasis on only a few).  The earnings release and recent news has addressed and alleviated the lingering concerns by investors over:
-Student loans business- Contracts are being sold off.  Company will focus on healthcare business
-Debt- covenents have been renegotiated into more favorable terms. Proceeds from sale of Student Loans contracts will be used to pay off some debt to the point of easily manageable levels
-Healthcare business- continues to grow. More contracts secured. Mgmt also confirmed a robust pipeline of new contracts in the works. Margins expected to be 30% sustainably once we re-open

Like everyone, the quarter was impacted by covid. no surprise. The first unaffected quarter will be rockstar- hitting the screens of all investors that are currently unaware. As a turnaround story these companys cannot be easily found.

1)
On the conference call, we see for the first time two institutional investor participants.
Chris Krug- Chatham Harbor Capital (AUM unknown)
and
Craig Melcher- Tudor Investment Corporation (AUM 45B+, even small cap funds would have significant size)

During the conference call, these investors asked critical questions ot which management provided reassuring feedback and responses. What we draw fomr this is that new players in the institutional landscape are vocally following this name.

2)
A few days ago, the institutionally well-followed podcast known as The Contrarian Investor Podcast recently hosted an episode with Chris Krug above. (Link: contrarianpod....dot...com). in which Chris pitches PFMT as a table punding buy. Fast forward to 15 minutes 40 seconds. I recommend everyone listen to this pitch as he does an excellent job of simplifying a complicated company. Especially helpful for those sitting on the fence unsure whether to buy stock.


3)
An exclusive online investing network known as CoInvestor Club (coinvestorclub......dot.....com/) , followed by a many of NOrth Americas top hedgefund, micro/small/mid-cap portfolio managers, and high networth accredited investors has recently announced in their weekly newsletter and posted on twitter (@CoINvestorCLub1) that they will be hosting Chris Krug TOMORROW Wednesday May 19 to present his BEST investment idea- no other details shared.  Given the recent events, it is very likely that Chris continues to pitch PFMT. Volume uptick into the close today confirms this could be the case.

These new investors see the underlying value in Performant and have clearly done a thorough due dilligence. Expect a sophisticated educational campaign to initiate in the insitutional investing world. These are no longer small retail investors but large funds that will push the price much higher. Tomorrows presentation is only the begining. Expect many value and micro cap investors to be tuning in. Once PFMT is confirmed to be the best idea, expect a pop in the price. As well as continued spreading through word of mouth, mgmt appearing at investor conferences to generate exposure to investors. This was a $1B market cap company not too long ago.  This could be the last opportunity to buy this turnaround company at cheap levels before the coming multiple re-rate bring it to $8+ or it gets acquired at a significant  premium.",Company Discussion,,29,t3_ng58hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ng58hg/performant_financial_pfmt_the_facts/,13,0.89,[1621429354.0]

They are my current main plays, and I do detailed DD at 4% or if I see myself increasing my holding to 4%, and are long term hold.

&#x200B;

Feedback / questions / comments welcome. Happy to go into more detail, but for now have just done a very brief rationale for my positions:

&#x200B;

**£ Hollywood Bowl:** 8.35%. Love this company, branding, numbers (pre-Covid), great management, solid track record and steady growth (also pre-Covid).

**$ Microsoft:** 6.00%. It's just a great company doing well. Diverse, growing, and hungry. It's a growth and divi growth play.

**$ BMY:** 5.36%. Obviously disappointing results, but the treatments they have I believe will recover, plus solid looking pipeline at fairly advanced stages.

**$ AT&T:** 4.67%. I'm bullish and like what I see, from wireless to HBO. I work in backend telco systems and I delved into the Jan QTR end figures for their wireless division and loved what I saw, so increased my holding materially before the latest very impressive results.

**$ EPD:** 4.56%. Defensive and divi, feels undervalued, I like that it has a significant pipeline network built, port and storage infrastructure, significant LNG exposure, and had pretty robust results consider 2020 (commodity prices, Texan weather and Covid dampening demand.

**£ Games Workshop:** 4.52%. Crazy margins, great CEO / management, expansion possibilities, lore on point. It's up 23x over 5 years with divi reinvested, 18x without, it's a beast that'll be in the FTSE100 end of 2023, likely sooner.

**£ Sage Group:** 4.23%. Bit un-noticed but does HR / payroll / finance and is geographically well diversified and under loved. Legacy tech but I like it, divi and buybacks. I generally feel CRM systems (Salesforce most notable) get all the attention because obviously they're meant to drive sales, but other internal systems matter and are in desperate need of modernisation. (If you want a sexier but higher risk play if you accept this logic, consider Workday).

**£ Fevertree Drinks:** 3.8%. Convinced this company will be a monster, and maybe the next Monster. Originally a tonic specialist for Gin, it's targeting both international and other mixers for expansion. Market hugely over-reacted to decent results considering Covid, and I opened a sizeable position.

**$ CACI International:** 3.77%. Also a bit unnoticed, it's a software meets military intelligence and Gov IT company. No divi, and they are quite clear they have no intention of it (literally a Buffett approach, we can use the money better than you.. :)), but winning contracts and very deeply ingrained with US Gov / military.

**$ HBAN**: 3.76%. Regional US bank digesting an acquisition. I like the direction. Recent numbers were so-so and dipped to $14.50, which is was a chance for me to add 80% to my previous holding.

**$ HUN:** 3.2%. Funny story here, I found this by accident when HBAN dipped to $14.50 as was looking for data to understand that drop and put in ""Hunt"" for Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) and accidently went to Huntsman Corporation (HUN). Lucky for me I guess, as I was curious and liked what I saw. I was frantically buying under $28, and although the shares shot up following good results and a 15% divi increase, I still like it. I see nobody talking about them,  but they have made significant changes to their business over the last couple of years, so although revenue is falling, earnings are looking great. It's become a leaner business with a war chest for suitable acquisitions, seems undervalued and has a respectable and now fast growing divi.",,,52,t3_n7hr9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n7hr9d/my_top_holdings_and_why_i_hold_them/,12,0.81,[1620450008.0]

Submission,nnx7xm,Which indexes to use,Banana-Which,"I'm a Canadian investor (only started investing in the last 3-4 months), and I put a decent chunk of change in VFV when I started out. Unfortunately it seemed like I never made any money off of it, and more often than not I was 2 or 3% down. Sure, it seems like impatience considering I didn't wait very long, but I was making healthy gains in BMO, RY and TD (all bank stocks, so they're pretty safe). So can I get some advice, or explanation, as to why it looks this way?

I don't really want to spend a lot of time worrying about stocks, and I believe I'd be better off indexing 80%+ of my funds, but I don't really know how it works. Is VFV just a bad buy? Would I be better off going for VOO or VTI instead - but considering I'm buying with Canadian dollars am I losing money in conversion?

I've also looked at VGRO as another option but I'm not sure whether it's a good choice.

During the recovery, I learned that they hate higher interest rates. They also really hate inflation. They hate tech stocks when things they hate are happening (like inflation or interest rates). They hate high job numbers because economy is racing back, but also hate low job numbers because economy isn't racing back fast enough.

I understand most of that is connected, but what is the true catalyst of major selloffs in the tech industry? Fears of interest rate inceases? Is that their main fear and they're ready to sell at any potential hint at anything that could trigger rate increase?

Or is there something else they're scared of more than rates?

And is there an actual situation they like which encourages massive buying? Or is it just easier to short right now so hedge funds are pretending any little thing scares then but in reality the value of stocks are on the high side so they're riding them down before loading up and riding them back up?

This is so confusing.

Submission,n95ls5,APD - A company set to dominate the Hydrogen business (but not reliant),Traditional_Fee_8828,"I've been into Hydrogen for quite a while, and I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. $2/kg is considered a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

What are the current uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (It costs $4k to get a projected market size, I aint paying that shit, but for reference here's what wikipedia has to say: A gas cabinet is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

I listened into their conference call today to see what had to be said, and some very interesting points were made, that puts my bullish stance far higher. There is a lot of debate on the efficacy of green hydrogen. The argument is that its inefficient. Well, APD have aims to become the leaders of Blue Hydrogen, alongside their efforts to produce green hydrogen. Now, what is blue hydrogen many may ask. Well blue hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced using natural gas, with the CO2 emissions generated during the process being captured and stored. I plan on sending an email to investor relations to see if I can get more details on this, as I'm aware they sell CO2 and CO, but this development puts me very bullish on the company, as this would be an efficient way to produce hydrogen with low environmental impact. Blue Hydrogen is not a dream either. I posted yesterday on the Dutch Government's subsidies for a carbon capture project, which directly benefited APD. Carbon capture is already a reality. 

Another thing said during the conference call was that they're very bullish on is high purity Nitrogen in the electronics market. They've earned a lot of contracts, although some of them they cannot announce for client privacy reasons. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted 46% of sales in 2020, while hydrogen, syngas and related products constituted 22% of sales. Evidently they don't rely on hydrogen for revenue, but being the leading provider, they put themselves in a good position to profit heavily from the eventual move to hydrogen

 A lot of interesting questions were answered in the conference call, which I suggest anyone thinking about investing having read this should listen to. I've said it for quite a while, and I'll continue to say it, but hydrogen is the future for the majority of industries, and the safest investment you can make into hydrogen is APD, they have insanely strong earnings to their name (11% CAGR), and offer a 2% dividend as an added benefit of holding shares. They don't do any stock buybacks, but I'm completely fine with that. P/E of about 34, and earnings are not affected by any rises in natural gas (Their customers subsidise the cost of natural gas). 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but do they have room to fucking grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it.",Company Discussion,,7,t3_n95ls5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n95ls5/apd_a_company_set_to_dominate_the_hydrogen/,11,0.82,[1620656295.0]

Submission,n8ieiz,How to value stocks as a non-professional?,Caos_,"Hey, I have been investing in the stock market now for a couple of years. Started out as a very passive index ETF investor, but during the last year have transitioned my portfolio to be more stock heavy.  Due to this I have started to do my own research into individual companies. I find it somewhat easy with my value investing goals to identify good companies. The part I find extremely difficult (and I understand that I am not alone and that this is a multi-trillion dollar question) is to identify what is the ""fair"" value of a company?

I have tried to create my own DCF models and understand all the variables that go in to evaluating a company, but I have very quickly realized that I am way way out of my depth.

I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company.  Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

So my question is to the non-pro veterans of the stock market (or to anyone who has had success in getting a good value for their picks), how should an investor know when to buy when they think they have found a wonderful company?

Submission,n6xzai,Investing in tech in the current regulatory climate - theory and discussion.,BokuNoBokuNoBokuNo,"Hi all,

First time poster. I have been thinking about the future of tech investments. As some background, I work in the field of competition law & regulation. Currently there are cases against Google and Facebook in the US, the latter may even lead to divestiture or total breaking up of the ecosystem.

Aside from that there is regulation on the way in the EU, the DMA and DSA will have far reaching consequences for the profitability of app stores, causing me concerns about Apple. Aside from that Amazon is under investigation as well. Aside from app stores there are also strict rules surrounding search engines. 

Right now I feel like only Amazon and Microsoft will be able to deal properly with the fallout of the changing regulatory landscape. Amazon as it is so diversified that it's a safe bet somewhat. However, I'm worried that Amazon is already so high (and public opinion of their employment terms are so bad) that there will be some inevitable fallout.

Now I'm left wondering if Microsoft is the right long-term investment. They are not overly data reliant and are building up positions in more and more areas for professional software. The only thing that concerns me is that Microsoft has a bad track record when it comes to being innovative. I fear some of their projects will ultimately fail as they are becoming perhaps the ""dinosaur"" of the tech world. 

I was wondering about your views and opinions. How likely do you think it is that new regulation or antitrust interventions will significantly harm the growth potential of these stocks? Am I missing something in my evaluation?",,,13,t3_n6xzai,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n6xzai/investing_in_tech_in_the_current_regulatory/,11,0.93,[1620392547.0]

Submission,nmbg2b,Charge Point Due Dilligence,VonDerBerg,"

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn
* Shares Float 299mln
* Institutional ownership \~13%
* 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%;
* TAM $190bn
* Newly formed entity has no Debt. Cash & Cash Equivalents \~$650m.
* Exponential Revenue growth & estimated profitability in 2024 with 41% Gross Margin.

📷

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

Submission,nlv5hd,Stock warrants?,BongHits4Steve0,"Noob here! 🤣
I've been studying stocks and charts, and I've only been paper trading on webull. Trying to get a good understanding of things before getting my feet wet. I'd like to get into being a patten/swing trader eventually. I've still got a long way to go, but I'm committed. 

I see some really good gains on stock warrants,  and I've traded a few just playing around and done really well with them in the paper account. 

I genuinely try to stay away from the comments section on any stock, just for the fact that everyone and their mother thinks that the stock they've invested in is going to ""sky rocket to the moon"", regardless of how the chart is looking and I don't have time for mental games.

But I still glance at the comments every now and then. And it seems that anytime I look a comments on stock warrants, they seem get a bad rep, or people get belittled for bragging about about their gains because ""it's not a stock, it's a stock warrant""

So I've strayed away from warrants temporarily until I know more about them, because I don't want to waste my time practicing something on my paper account, if I'm not going to be able to apply it on a real account. 

It all boils down to two questions. Can stock warrants be traded like a regular stock? And if so, are the short term capital gains tax rates similar to that of a regular stock?",,,15,t3_nlv5hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nlv5hd/stock_warrants/,11,0.82,[1622074044.0]
Submission,nljpkq,Quantum Computing Stocks,meltyourtv,"Hey friends. I noticed that we recently just achieved classical computer obsoletion, with [the first quantum microchips being made to run at room temperature instead of around -400ºK](https://www.xanadu.ai/hardware). I'm wondering if anyone knows of any publicly traded quantum computing companies, or any companies like Google or Microsoft that are public that either plan to dabble in it or have already started.

I'm no quantum physicist or code-monkey, just an audio engineer geek, but what little knowledge I have of quantum computers is it fixes the problem that classical computers have had from the beginning: only being truly serial binary machines. Classical computers use binary to have absolute values: 1 or 0 (1 bit). Quantum computers use quantum entanglement of laser light to create superimposed values: 1 or 0, 1 and 0, 1 and 1, 0 and 0 (1 qubit). Not many know this, but when you have Google Chrome, Steam, and Spotify all open, your computer is switching off between processing power very quickly because binary only works in 1 or 0! A quantum computer can truly actually be processing more than 1 thing at the same time, because it can be 1 or 0, 1 and 0, etc.!

This technology can be applied to logistics, blockchains, payment networks (could potentially process near ∞/second transactions simultaneously as opposed to VISA's 1700/second), etc. The possibilities are endless and I want in!!!",,,18,t3_nljpkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nljpkq/quantum_computing_stocks/,8,0.73,[1622042839.0]

Looking for the best possible price to pay for a share. Now to business.




#Apple Inc


Ticker **$AAPL** - has been ranging since last year between ~$100 and ~$140. This is promptly after we had the split from ~$330. You would imagine that some investors who weren't involved see this as an opportunity to buy more into the company at an affordable price per share, there are definitely also other investors looking to liquidate their holdings in order to get another ride out of the stock at a good price. 

The [distribution schematic chart](https://imgur.com/voCVxwf) and annotations for visual.
At **PSY** which we would call the preliminary supply, is where the first batch of selling took place, hence the ""pause"" in price at the level. But as you would have guessed, investors ""_bought the dip_"" which resulted in a strong price advance until it reached the buying climax (**BCLX**). 


At this point is where a lot of institutions unload more of their shares while buying is still high. Most uninformed investors will buy a share at any price given, this is why it's so easy for the big guys to distribute / liquidate his positions while we prop up the price.


With the first batch distributed, price will automatically drop back to support - this is the automatic reaction (**AR**). This is obviously because there aren't any *strong hands* fully committed to the stock anymore, at least at that point in time.

But since we keep buying the dip (not just novice investors, even professional fund managers may also get in the buying pressure), price will rally up again until the secondary test (**ST**). Again supply comes in the market as shares are being liquidated and price drops back to **support**. Now we have a trendline we can use to buy our stock as price keeps dipping. While doing this, it creates a low higher than the previous meaning - the stock is still trending upwards, giving investors hope that price found a floor and will continue pushing higher


This is why after the up thrust (**UT**), price drops just a little then pushes even higher. This would be the up thrust after distribution (**UTAD**). The big money here has now left the party. Their big sell orders are even seen at the supply volume (see bottom of the screen) This reminds me of the situation with Berkshire Hathaway saying it was a ""big mistake"" to sell their Apple holdings but here's something you should understand.


An investor cannot stay married to his investment for life. His aim is to get in at a good price, get out when his objective has been met, making a good profit out of the situation. Warren and his partners ""bought low and sold dear""  as they always advise, made a comment as if it was a mistake but really they probably want to buy again, but some profits have to be taken along the way and this is a great example. 


Once the shares have been distributed into the market, price keeps dropping. The trick here is to tire out other investors interested in making money in this market. This means, once we ""buy the dip"" off the support number 2 trendline we are given a bit of hope then after price keeps plummeting.



**Why I believe we're reaccumulating now**? 

Price is most likely going to break and close below the trendline support, [inducing fear](https://imgur.com/oCYJz0l) and forcing early buyers to sell out of their positions. There could even be bad fundamentals over the next few weeks/months on the company, or missed earnings. This contribute to price declines. 


While this may be seen as negative, institutional investors who know what they are doing get a lot of shares available to purchase at very discounted prices because sensational media has scared the individual investor out of his positions (*sometimes even fund managers who don't know what they're doing will sell out during bad news and declines*). 


This would be the process called a terminal shakeout, or a spring. This is when a lot of fear is in the market, shares being sold at a loss transferring the shares from weak hands (uninformed/novice investors) to strong hands. In situations like these, buying at the bottom of the range is best and price will eventually blow past the ""ceiling"" that's been keeping it low.


This level is where my [limit orders](https://imgur.com/mqm1yyv) are placed. 


Once price has strong commitment, big money will then eventually once again take control of the stock price and a mark-up would ensue. 



**This whole process can take weeks, or even months before it fully unfolds but it eventually does. The analysis here is based on _price behavioral systems_ developed by Richard D. Wyckoff, a technical analysis titan almost a century ago and retaught by the late Prof. Hank Pruden from San Francisco, Golden Gate University** With this, you can pair up with the typical fundamental DD mostly shared in these boards

I would enjoy a healthy commentary below. Best wishes

TL;DR. AAPL stock may induce fear causing early buyers to dump their stock into the hands of institutions in the next weeks/months. The best prices to buy in may be around $85-$100 and targets are set to record highs ($300+). The range may be coming to an end.",Company Analysis,,28,t3_ngga8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ngga8k/apple_inc_technical_analysis_due_diligence/,8,0.57,[1621456407.0]

However, most banks are telling everyone to sell, with some saying the price can drop down to €0,40.

There is no info on the amount of Shorted Capital: I always come across N/A. Which sucks, cause I can't see if the Stock is being forced down or if it's just its bad fundamentals.

It appears people do NOT tend to buy those specific ETFs.

Now I understand how these are bad long term investments after reading this [article](https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/2016-08-18/why-leveraged-etfs-are-horrible-investments) from us-news. But I am thinking of a short-term investment at least day trade or few weeks to at most 2 years.

Watched this [segment](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-11-15/the-pros-and-cons-of-leveraged-etfs-video) on bloomberg on pros and cons of said ETFs. The representative also said that these ETFs are not good for long term investment. One of the ETFs, $GUSH which currently trades at \~$92 almost hit $100,000. It has low volume however has more than $750 million in assets. 

To anyone who has traded ETFs I wanted to ask:

1. How long do you usually hold them
2. Are there any decays applied to THESE ETFs. As some futures ETFs from proShare gets decayed.
3. Does Robinhood and fidelity charge fee for trading ETFs such as $LBAD or $LABU
4. Say if the ETF you hold goes to \~$100,000 per share, if you were to sell, who would possibly want to buy a share of ETF for $100,000?

&#x200B;

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

&#x200B;

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

&#x200B;

>Slide showcasing owned assets

&#x200B;

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. “eyes” are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming’s audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&#x200B;

>There’s a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That’s our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&#x200B;

>And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we’re  pretty excited about.

&#x200B;

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

Submission,nir5xo,Buying World ETFs In Other Currencies,ohiopolicedepartment,"I just finished watching a video by former hedge fund manager Lars Kroijer. In the video, he explains how risk-averse investors with a long time frame should invest only in global markets. This strategy leads to maximum diversification. 

I gather that this risk minimizing effect as a result of diversification also leads to less exposure of swings in currencies (when buying instruments in currencies other than that of your home countrys). However, if you live in country A with currency A, and buy a world tracker instrument in country B with currency B, will this cancel out the diversification effects, as my purchase would now be subject to swings between currency A and B?

Example:

\- Citizen in Denmark that has a local currency DKK  
\- Buys *iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF* (due to low 0.20% expense ratio) in USD

Would the above person cancel out the positive effects of diversification in regards to currency swings because he would now simply be subject to DKK/USD swings?

Is this actually the case? Looking at the past decade (I know this doesn't predict future performance per say) but the large caps have grown considerably. AAPL for example doubled from 1T to 2T market cap in just two years which is wild. I know their growth has slowed since then but with them constantly killing earnings and continuously diversifying (M chips etc. ) is there any reason for them to slow or be outperformed by smaller companies this decade? I know they're considered a little overvalued, but that's the nature of large cap growth stocks in general.

Additionally, inflation tends to be less hard on large caps compared to smaller ones. Depending on how much inflation is coming over the next say 3-5 years, won't this also be another advantage for the largest cap companies?

Submission,nbjloz,"$INVE disrupting NFC, most recently in Needles & Cannabis",DickNixon37,"[Identiv (INVE)](https://files.identiv.com/brochure/Identiv_Brochure.pdf) is a Nasdaq listed small cap growth stock with a solid core business and huge growth pipeline as a leading innovator in Radio-frequency identification “RFID”, particularly Near-Field Communication “NFC”. Identiv designs and manufactures millions of low-cost RFID chips that enable the internet of things “IOT”, offering highly tuned and optimized antennas, systems, software and security. Identiv has been selling [smart ID and perimeter access card systems](https://www.identiv.com/products/physical-access-control/hardware/freedom-access-control-hardware/) to institutions including the [federal government ](https://www.identiv.com/us-government-ficam-solution/)for many years, and is now seeing high growth in [other verticals](https://www.identiv.com/products/rfid-nfc-inlays/hf-inlays-tags/) such as [prescription drugs with CVS](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/cvs-pharmacy-app-introduces-feature-people-visual-impairments).

I expect compound annual sales growth of over +20-25% for several years with huge near term upside driven by opportunities in high-tech syringes and cannabis (particularly Canada). The company has recently launched a Developers Kit to help customers find more use cases, for which INVE can prototype quickly. Over the past year, manufacturing capacity has increased +70% from 130 million units to 220 million units, and [management has commented recently](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) “That's not even a lot of buffer for what we're seeing as our baseline demand”.

As of 5/12, the stock is trading at $14, a valuation of 3x Enterprise Value / 2022E Forward Sales of $120M. With high visibility for 20-25% sales growth, I believe the stock today is worth $26 based on 5x Forward Sales. If Identiv delivers on their pipeline of smart syringes, cannabis labeling and other innovative products, sales will exceed $250 million by 2024 and the stock will trade \*significantly higher\* than where it is today. As the world gets more digital, I expect INVE will sell billions of NFC tags configured for [countless applications](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/the-need-for-enabling-touchless-technologies-whitepaper.pdf).

**Recent updates on Needles --** INVE’s customer is awaiting FDA approval for smart syringes for which they are targeting 100 million units from INVE with an average selling price of $1-1.50 = $100-150 million opportunity. [Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963), “Now these are super precise auto injectors for cancer, autoimmune and other treatments that have to be dispensed in exact amounts, at the right temperature, at the right dispense rate and exactly the right needle insertion. In this design, we're incorporating multi-sensor features, including temperature and fluid dispensing measurements, as well as authenticity and data protection.""

**Recent updates on Cannabis --** INVE is also well positioned to capture market share for mandated [RFID tagging of cannabis](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/tag/rfid/) in Canada and [potentially in the USA](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/06/1981126/0/en/Identiv-to-Showcase-NFC-Solutions-at-WestPack-and-First-ever-Cannabis-Packaging-Summit.html) in the future, which is a 1 billion unit opportunity in Canada alone. [Per 10K](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-012914/) – “Governments can track the quality and authenticity of cannabis products for compliance and especially for tax collection”.

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963), ""So, I think, the cannabis one you're referring to which is in the public domain, there's a big opportunity out there. And we mentioned that we've provided sample rolls to them sample products. It's very far along, but it's a government program. You would think they'd want to drive it as fast as possible, because it's going to increase their tax collection capability and certainty. But government programs go with the pace they go. So, it should be hitting in the relatively near-term. But again, with us, if we say it's going to fall in the third quarter or fourth quarter per se, and then it pushes out, that can change expectations. So it's on track, and we're comfortable with the position. We're in there. And it's moving along and they're taking samples and assessing it, but exactly when it becomes mandated is not certain, give or take three to six months.”

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) ""Back on this cannabis, 1-billion-unit opportunity. It almost sounds like you sort of won the technology bake out there. Is that a fair characterization? Or is that still going on?""... ""In terms of compliance and ability -- so the short answer is, yes. But to be clear, being a government program, it won't be sole source. Are we pretty -- well, I wanted to not overstate anything, because nothing's been awarded? But, we're certainly at the forefront of those who, more than comply, you completely satisfy everything they're looking for.""

Excerpt:

> Live from New York, it's Tesla's competitors trying to steal the show from Elon Musk.

> Four automakers aired electric vehicle commercials during the ""Saturday Night Live"" episode hosted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

> Lucid Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Volvo showcased electric vehicles in advertisements in a bid to grab a portion of the spotlight on a night featuring the billionaire widely credited with leading an EV revolution.

And:

> Ford showed the Mustang Mach-E, an electric crossover version of its famed pony car. Volkswagen showed off the VW ID.4, its first electric SUV. And Volvo showed off the XC-90 plug-in hybrid SUV.

Lucid Motors: ""The future it's impossible to see and when it's finally here, it might not be what you'd expect it might just be better.""

Ford Motors is the pretender of the bunch, being so behind in the race to be the next Tesla (but still good enough to be a prospective takeover target for the Next Tesla).

Volvo: Why did they have to promote a hybrid and spoil the battery electric vehicle party? Volvo is more likely to be the dark horse for becoming the Tesla of commercial EVs, not the next Tesla when it comes to consumer EVs.

Last, but not least, the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, put its stamp on the SNL opportunity by promoting not one, but two brands:

https://www.carscoops.com/2021/05/audi-ford-vw-and-lucid-ran-ev-commercials-during-elon-musks-snl-appearance/

> During the first 30 minutes of the show, commercials were aired for the Audi e-tron, Ford Mustang Mach-E, VW ID.4, and Lucid Air. Volvo also made use of all the interest in SNL by airing a commercial for the XC90 hybrid.

""Before it can change the world, it has to change yours,"" goes the ad for the VW ID.4.  It's ironic, because this is exactly what happened to Volkswagen itself.

Before emerging as the Next Tesla, it had to be ""born"" from Dieselgate.

Submission,n9j8ff,Tech Slide Hypothetical: Opinions Wanted!,UhhhmWut,"Specifically regarding the growth tech that boomed so hard last year. 
Think NIO(& other EVs), PLTR, BB, etc.

This is a specific question that I’ll build up to, I’ll try to keep it concise.

TLDR - what if the “growth tech boom” was an unachievable anomaly?

Hypothetical scenario for argument’s sake, using NIO just for it’s numbers:


-purchased at exact ATH of 66.99 (lmao never noticed that)

-Pre-covid price of ~$3-5

-Ignoring strong (or weak) fundamentals (of any of these companies, I’m talking “on balance” of the boom, maybe ARK is a better example, whatever)

-Ignoring the practice of DCA that would surely aide anybody’s chance at returns.

...

Let’s say sweet little NIO tumbles back to sub-$10 levels, and continues to do fantastically as a company. Their price starts to recover over 3-5 years, but never to that ATH? Maybe ever? 

My reason for asking is, what if the covid retail investor influx (truly an anomaly) pushed these stocks to such monstrous levels that, even if the stock appreciated favourably compared to pre-covid prices, (pretending the spike never happened), they may never return to such skyscraping prices as they did, barring another anomaly?


I understand and fully believe tech is the future (duh) and yes large tech stocks have multi multi bagged sustainably (FAANG) before. But I suppose the pain’s starting to get to me and I’m wondering if a true recovery for lots of these will happen, even if extreme fundamental progress continues to be made.

My heart tells me (especially when profitability is achieved) that much of these will exceed their ATH’s, but I’m curious as to yalls thoughts on the boom we just witnessed.

So far I've found that CCI, ADX and ADL are very helpful for daytrading for me and I've noticed that I'm making better decisions based on them - it's so much easier to see the trend and momentum with them. I've also found EMA clouds and trying to integrate them in my analysis, but I'm still not sure if I understand their purpose correctly.

Currently, I've got the following EMA's: 5-13, 34-50, 72-79, but I'm not sure how useful they are for given timeframes, meaning is 5-13 cloud better on 1 minute chart or 5 minute chart? I've seen stocks finding support on the top or bottom of the the same cloud, but one would do it on a 5 minute chart, the other on 1 minute chart.

Is there any general rule to follow here or maybe each pattern is different and I should find the timeframe that correlates with these clouds the best?

Submission,nsxo9n,The Misdeeds of Culper & Hindenburg Research,MainStreetBetz,"Hindenburg & Culper Research: A Danger To Free Markets

Disclosure: 

I am writing this article to expose the dangers that malicious short selling research companies pose to markets, and why it is essential for regulators to address the issues surrounding the unlawful tactics that short sellers may employ in order to drastically reduce the share price of publicly traded
companies.  I am writing this article using the example of On trak Behavioural Health Services (""The Company"" hereafter), a publicly traded company.  I have owned shares of this company in the past, and may purchase shares of this company in the future.  I will also include a few examples of other companies in this due diligence, and everything written
herein is merely my opinion.  I am not a financial advisor.  Please do your own research.  This article is for entertainment purposes only. Let's get to it.

What happened and why am I writing this?:

The Company provides online mental health and behavioural health services for people suffering with mental illness, and the platform is actually genious.  The Company saw the need for access to 24/7 1-on-1 mental health care via online service, which is much more accessible for individuals who require immediate care or are care 
avoidant.  The service is widely used by people with substance abuse issues, veterans, trauma survivors, etc.  Furthermore, The Company's modelling showed that providing
this type of health care online caused a huge savings benefit for the medical system and insurance companies on the whole, because it treated the issues at the source, online and often prevented very expensive post incident care (think of police and hospital resources).  Insurance companies, and even Medicare and Medicaid, were aware of the savings and included The Company's services in their health insurance plans.  The Company's stock saw a meteoric rise from about $3 to over $100 as more insurance
companies signed on to the service.

Then what?:

In early 2019, The Company's stock was trading between $10-$15.  A short selling research company under the name ""Culper Research"" began covering the stock, and took particular
issue with The Company's CEO at the time.  Culper Research itself is neither a company or really a legit entity.  It operates under pseudonyms and behind proxy servers, with no real way of contacting them through any legitimate means.  Often, websites that they operate to provide their ""research"" publicly are registered to law offices or shell companies in the Caribbean or South Pacific.  They mostly attack companies through social media platforms like twitter, stocktwits, shady websites, etc and then pay to have articles submitted through the newswire via their offshore company.  Anyway, it was Culper's opinion at the time that The Company would be unable to secure insurance companies into their behavioural health services system so they provided research attacking ""The Company's"" CEO.  

The intial Culper hit piece was fairly tame, it questioned The Company's fundamentals and ability to sign clients.  Culper took particular beef with the CEO and filled the report with the usual FUD.  The report coincided with a hedge fund taking a MASSIVE SHORT POSITION AGAINST THE COMPANY, AMOUNTING TO 40% OF ALL AVAILABLE SHARES.  So there was a lot of money behind this ""research"" and a huge interest in The Company's failure.  Things didn't go well for Culper and the hedge funds associated with them, and The Company signed more insurance companies and clients and the stock kept rising.   

This is when things turned ugly.  Let me say this, I have never seen anything so disgusting published across the newswire without any sort of legal repercussion.  Culper Research paired with Hindenburg Research and stepped up their attacks immensely.  You apes familiar with the GME short seller reports know how ugly they can get.  In the subsequent reports, Culper and Hindenburg accused the CEO of embezzlement, sex crimes, fraud, misapproriation of shareholder money and even supporting wars.  Racist jabs
and questioning the character of the care providers were all listed in the report.  The Company's stock briefly fell, but recovered and kept rising in spite of the report.  Upon reading it, I contacted The Company's investor relations and notified them of the report, which they said they were aware of and could not discuss how they were addressing this legally.  The report was deleted from Culper and Hindenburg's website at a later date (of course).

Well, the stock kept rising.

Culper and Hindenburg needed to step it up because their hedge fund clients were losing hundreds of millions of dollars.  And step it up they did.  They began publishing reports almost twice a week and referring to them over the newswire and spamming them across twitter.  Stock message boards became flooded with individuals who would hyperlink the reports they issued and spread FUD.  Message boards that were generally quiet were flooded with bearish messages and false statements.  Culper and Hindenburg stepped up their illegal activity, which was admitted in their own reports, by contacting health care workers who work for the platform by pretending to need to behavioural health services
they provided.  They would mask as being suicidal or depressed, and then they would press the health care workers about their pay, compensation packages, what they know about the CEO and the company, which health care insurance companies did they use, etc.  Culper and Hindenburg then released their findings in their weekly (almost daily) reports.
For example, they'd write 'when we contacted the clinician using their service, they told us that they only worked 20 hours a week and that they were not receiving compensation for 
mental stress'.

Still, the stock kept rising.  Once again I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were contacting health care employees to uncover confidential information, 
and that they were spinning it to create FUD.  The Company said that they were aware of the issue and that they were advising their staff to be wary.

Culper and Hindenburg then began issuing reports which had patient information included.  This was done to scare patients into thinking that their information was not secure.  Once again, this was all in their reports.  My guess is that they had one of their own people hired by The Company, and this 'health care provider' proded patients for information.  Either that, or they were just flat out lying.  The reports would say, 'patient did not have any reduction in suicidal thoughts', 'patient did not feel better at the end of the session', 'several patients felt 
confused after the session'.  They would couple this information with a decline in client retention rates or turnover.  Remember, these are extremely vulnerable, often care avoidant individuals, who are desperate for mental health care.  This is a sickening act in my opinion!  I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were releasing client information and discussions in their reports and The Company gave me the usual response.  The stock kept rising.

In my opinion, their latest nasty shot at The Company could very well be the worst.  This is opinion and can not be proven, but I suspect it to be true.  The Company's largest signed client
was Aetna Health Insurance followed by Cigna.  It is my opinion that Culper and Hindenburg began to lobby Aetna and Cigna with their false reports, accusations, FUD, and the 
patient information on an almost daily basis.  The goal was to have these health insurance providers drop The Company's mental health services from their insurance plans.  Many veterans and individuals locked at home with abusers or their own thoughts during the Covid crisis are dependant on these services in order to get through their day-to-day, and can not afford the care unless it is covered by their health insurance plans.  Well, if they were lobbying, it worked.  Aetna abruptly terminated their agreement with The Company, and thousands of patients were forced to lose care with their health care provider or be transitioned to another provider.  This was devastating.  Hundreds of health care service providers lost their jobs, and thousands of patients will likely no longer get the care they require.  Upon announcing the termination of the contract with Aetna, the stock dropped from $105 to about $28 or so.

I notified the company that Aetna was likely lobbied by Culper and Hindenburg, and they responded that they needed to focus on patient care and patient transitioning at the moment, but that A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAD MADE THEM AWARE OF THIS.  Culper and Hindenburg have since deleted all these reports from their websites and Twitter accounts, however The Company has all the reports and so do I.

Now the hedge funds that backed Culper and Hindenburg still have a big problem.  Despite the fall in the stock price, the trading volume has been extremely low and they have been unable to cover most of their short position.  The stock is still currently shorted to the tune of about 36% of the free float.  On top of that, much of their short position was taken between
$10-$15 per share, so they are still way underwater.  On top of that, the company is recovering.  They are signing Medicare and Medicaid care contracts.  They are signing a service
provision contract with Veteran's Affairs directly.  Recently, the Biden administration has earmarked $96bn for the VA and VA mental health services in the new $6tn budget.  The CEO of The Company resigned his position and a new CEO, a veteran in the health care industry, was brought on as CEO.  I believe the new CEO will be much more ruthless with Culper and 
Hindenburg, and I believe that this is why they have deleted a lot of their research.  If I were a betting man, I'd say that they have multiple lawsuits coming their way.

Why did I write this?:

A friend of mine was a military helicopter pilot who served in Afghanistan.  He was a career military kind of guy, who really loved his job and serving his Country.  When he came back from Afghanistan, he completely changed.  A normally outgoing person, he became withdrawn, anti-social, and began behaving oddly.  He confided in his close friends that he was struggling
with mental health issues, but was afraid to seek help because of the stigma attached to it and fear of losing his rank.  This is someone who would have benefited immensely from these services because they are 24/7, confidential, and covered through health insurance.  Sadly, he didn't get the help he needed and committed suicide in 2017.  

Was Culper or Hindenburg ever held responsible for their actions?  Do they simply withdraw into the woodwork?  Will they continue to lobby other insurance providers in an attempt to drive the price down further?  How many lives were lost and will be lost by people who are told that they no longer have access to mental health care services?

I’m watching it closely, but I feel like I have been beating my head against the wall because no one does anything to hold them accountable.

They're a new IPO on the LSE who register patents on chip designs. They have some very very impressive growth figures over the last couple of years and as such have quite a high market cap, currently £2 billion on a £44 million 2020 revenue. Worth noting that the 2020 revenue is up 539% on 2019. They look like a good long term growth stock but I'm a bit worried that the growth is already priced in. They have dropped 21% from IPO last month which suggests other think the same. Not sure if this is a good dip for a buy in or a sign of continued downwards progression.

Submission,nq7611,Any advice for minimizing losses as this point on a short... and hear me out for those who would rather ridicule for having done so! AMC,sgim43,"Overall I know the glaring recommendation is stop messing with what I'm not familiar with, but would really like to get back $10k of losses before exiting. If you have the time and patience to listen to my buffoonery...

I was lucky owning AMC before the initial short squeeze. Gained $16k and sold! I was only looking to buy and hold at that time but once something like that happens as a newbie it kind of sticks on your radar. I attributed this gain to luck not just for myself but for most involved really combined with some greed being exploited. So after that and reading it was very unlikely to happen again as hedge funds would be more prepared... well that made a lot of sense to me. So when there were then 2 quicks runs from around $9-12 range then back down and I made about $650 each time in a just a couple days (shorting after $11.5 and covering around $9.50).

This third instance I was just going to to the same, was just looking for a little profit.. but it clearly hasn't worked out the same. And kept buying a little more as it went up. Then all of a sudden the price went from $18 a share to over $30 and I got nervous thinking of these claims of it going up over $100/share... so I cover 800 of the 1700 shares I was short at $34 last week (on the spike up to $36) ...only to see it crash quick. Where then I was pissed I let fear set in as I'm never like that. I compared the price trends/graph on other squeezes and it looked to match other reversals... so that then made me think I was going to be missing out on all the continued price drops that were to come and I was an idiot of paying $34 to cover and I should get those shorts back to at least recoup some of what I would have otherwise if I didn't cover then.... so re-shorted the 800 around $26..... only to see it go back over $32 shortly after, maximizing my current losses in a few steps for nothing.

So now I've lost all my previous gains I made from owning on the first squeeze and the couple shorts a I did after... plus another $10k+. Maybe be even closer to $15k right now. My idea was if I could just skip out on all this volatility and possibility of getting squeezed to oblivion and purchase 1000 shares to hedge if it keeps climbing... I can hold and let things play out and then when we're in a reversal downtrend then close out.

My reason for not simply closing it is because I'd lose my short positions and they're not always available... and I do believe it's going to go down (although I know Reddit is probably not the best place to voice such thoughts without vitriol coming my way). The two previous other instances I shorted I'd say only 10% of my orders went though and I would have to sit there repeatedly trying to get an order to short to go through, rejected for market unavailability. If I close my shorts I could very well be not getting them back if everyone else sees the stock as being in a reversal and want to short as well at that time... I would lose my ability to gain back what I'm down by just closing out now.

No I don't have the ability to place options and looking at the application on Merrill Lunch it doesn't seem like I would qualify.

IDK... I was even thinking of just closing everything out and hoping to regain some loses if there's still room to run, closing and buying 1000 perhaps... but boy would that suck if it went down... taking the loses only to buy and it turn out to be a downtrend. Seeing as I don't mind holding on to for awhile it seems the odds of the price going down are more likely than up. At least at some point where i can exit and reduce some of the loses.

I do appreciate you taking the time to read and any advice. No this isn't my life savings or immediate funds I need to make ends meet, but part of it was vacation money. And I'm fine by missing vacation myself, but this is really making me feel like shit as it was more been about taking my gf somewhere for our two year anniversary, and I've already done tons of planning... just haven't finalize bc of COVID concerns. She's single mom whose deadbeat ex hasn't paid child support in the last year and deserves a vaca too. Really upsets me the idea of not going after talking it up in the past few months... and although I'm sure I still will book the trip as a matter of principle.... I really shouldn't if I don't get back $10k on these 1700 shares. $7 drop would be a blessing. I was looking to so if there was some consult option on Merrill but it looks like on ongoing advisory service not a consult option.

Anyway, thanks for listening and and or anyone who may have something helpful to offer, not simply pointing out the obvious fact I clearly made errors and shouldn't be messing with shorting.",,,85,t3_nq7611,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nq7611/any_advice_for_minimizing_losses_as_this_point_on/,10,0.59,[1622588550.0]

2 Key Things From 3D Systems' Earnings Call That Investors Should Know | NASDAQ

Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD reported first-quarter 2021 results that easily beat the Wall Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock skyrocketed 35% the next day.

In the first quarter, the 3D printing company's revenue rose 7.7% year over year (and 17% excluding the impact of divestitures to $146.1 million. Growth was driven by continued strength in the healthcare segment and a stabilizing of the industrial segment, which was hard hit by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.


Moreover, the company posted a profit on both an adjusted basis and according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted for one-time items, net income landed at $20.9 million, or $0.17 per share, up from a loss per share of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. GAAP net income was $45.2 million, or $0.36 per share, up from a loss of $18.9 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2020.

Earnings releases tell only part of the story. Following are two key things from 3D Systems' Q1 earnings call that investors should know.

1. The company's competitive advantages
From CEO Jeffrey Graves' remarks:

There are three things that inspire my confidence in our future. And I believe they should inspire yours as well. First, we clearly by far have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry. [...] Second, I'm convinced that we have the brightest and most creative application engineers in the industry. [...]

Third, as one of the largest and most experienced companies in the industry, we have the scale and the infrastructure to not only support our customers' needs when they initially implement additive manufacturing, but also sustain them over the lifetime of their equipment by providing key services and consumables that are vital to their ongoing business success.

As to Graves' first point, 3D Systems does have the broadest offerings in the 3D printing industry in terms of technology to my knowledge, at least among publicly traded companies. It has several polymer technologies and at least one metal 3D printing technology.

For a couple of points of comparison: Rival Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS, another well-established pure-play 3D printing company, doesn't have a metal 3D printing technology. Newly public Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM is just in the early stages of commercializing its metal technology and only recently expanded into polymers via its February acquisition of EnvisionTEC.

His second point about having ""the brightest and most creative application engineers"" is too subjective to address.

I'll also agree with Graves' third point about 3D Systems having a scale and experience advantage, at least relative to most other players. That said, there's a caveat here. Under the prior two CEOs, the company prematurely released products that had quality issues. So, while scale does usually provide various advantages, it won't do so if customers are hesitant to buy a product from a company due to concerns about quality. Hopefully, this issue is largely behind 3D Systems, but investors still need to keep an eye on it.

2. Ramping up its healthcare business organically and through acquisitions
From Graves' remarks:

As you can see in our numbers for Q1, we're seeing rising demand for new applications, particularly in our healthcare business. To meet this demand forecast, we're expanding our Denver, Colorado, location by roughly 50%. [...] Through this next phase of investment [...] we'll be able to reduce time to market for new medical applications, continue expanding our product offerings, and better support the holistic needs of our growing healthcare customer base.

In Q1, 3D Systems' healthcare revenue surged 39% year over year to $72.5 million. This segment accounted for 49.6% of the company's total revenue of $146.1 million. So its business is now essentially evenly split between healthcare and industrial.

As Graves said on the prior quarter's call, the company's healthcare business ""brings a bit higher gross margin on average than our industrial business."" So, naturally, it makes great sense to focus somewhat more on applications that are more profitable.

In addition, 3D Systems announced several days before it released its Q1 results that it had acquired Allevi, a small Philadelphia-based bioprinting company. Bioprinting refers to using 3D printing technology to print animal and human cells to produce three-dimensional, functional tissues. This was a smart move and expands the company's involvement in this space, as it's been collaborating with United Therapeutics (NASDAQ: UTHR in this realm since 2017.

Graves said one key intermediate-term application of bioprinting is to help pharmaceutical companies speed up the drug development process. A longer-term goal of those working in this space is to print fully functional solid human organs such as the liver, heart, and kidneys for transplant purposes. Regenerative medicine, as it's often called, is in its infancy, but it has humongous growth potential.

Energy Transfer (ticker: ET) is the people behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. Yes that's the same pipeline that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is/was protesting because they were worried the project could contaminate their drinking water/the environment among other concerns. The tribe has an ongoing legal case against ET and is seeking to have the pipeline shut down. The U.S. District Court for D.C. ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct an environmental review of the project. There was a chance the the pipeline would be shutdown while the review happened and could last until 2022, but recently the USACE determined that the pipeline did not need to be shut down while the review was conducted. On top of that they had excellent Q1 earnings summarized below, and have had strong, recent insider buying. Overall the fundamentals look strong, the pipeline will probably not be shut down, and it's not too late to hop on board this rocket.

Bullish Components:

1.

2. Shit load of insider buying in March and April. See link in #1
3. [Recent price targets](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ET) between 12 - 14 a share. Currently below 10.
4. Very [Strong Q1 Earnings](https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-reports-first-quarter-2021-results) and forward guidance
5. Trading in a rising channel and looks due for a breakout. Seriously just look at [this](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ET) and tell me you don't see tendies at the end

Bearish Components:

1. Apparently pipelines are targets for cyber [attacks these days](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/08/us/politics/cyberattack-colonial-pipeline.html).
2. The DAPL legal case is still playing out. It's possible that sometime in the future the pipeline could be shut down. However, it might not matter. (I would link an SA article here but this place doesn't approve apparently. You can search on SA by title ""A Dakota Access Pipeline Shutdown Doesn't Change the Energy Transfer Thesis""

Submission,nbqkkp,Individual stock picking versus an index,TechnoForBreakfast,"One of the easiest benchmarks to look for in a stock is to see if a stock has beat VTI/SPY on a 1 year and 5 year chart or not. If the stock hasn't done that, why would you pick an individual stock and introduce more risk to yourself? what are the chances that a stock would beat the index if it hasnt even done that in the past? of course given there are no major catalysts that would launch the earnings/revenue into the stratosphere compared to the past. 

This of course applies to stocks which have been around for a while and havent seen multiples in revenue/income growth. Slowly and gradual revenue/income increases dont matter, because the market also grows slow and steady. Then of course there are other reasons like major changes to market like increasing steel/lumber prices in the economy which benefit steel/lumber industries.

for example, Coca cola (KO) has increased 20% in the past 5 years versus VTI growing 100% - why would anyone buy it? even in a market crash in 2020, it crashed harder than VTI. 

Most people do not beat the index when it comes to stocks. What are other reasons someone would pick individual stocks?",,,14,t3_nbqkkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nbqkkp/individual_stock_picking_versus_an_index/,8,0.76,[1620937714.0]

Submission,nbmqtg,Darn I've been doing it all wrong!,apooroldinvestor,"So I think I figured something out.  VTI is the average stock market return which is ""hard to beat"".

I have a few ideas of stocks and or indexes that may beat VTI, but I shouldn't need 20 or 30 stocks to produce that ""alpha"" right?

I mean like people have been saying.  Are they right that a good percentage of my portfolio should be a strong base in VTI or VOO?  And then above that I can make my ""bets"" on stocks I think will outperform, but they need only be maybe 10 to 20 positions?

This way I'd have less stress instead of constantly looking for stock ideas and not risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio?

But to me there's no point in adding stock picks that don't beat VTI even as some type of ""stability"" in my portfolio.  For example JNJ.  I see no reason now in owning it versus just VTI, for me at least.

Something like UNH or HD in my research are good picks to actually produce some alpha beyond VTI.  As are maybe MSFT AAPL etc.  Maybe NVDA too.

Trulieve ($TCNNF) announced its buying Harvest (HRVSF). They are issuing something like .1147 TCNNF shares per HRVSF share. 

Most articles are highlighting that based on TCNNF closing price last Friday,  this is a 35% premium for Harvest shareholders, equaling approximately a value of $4.79 per HRVSF share (or spiked about 17% at open today). 

My question: 

When the shares convert over,  how exactly did that work? Do HRVSF shareholders get an equivalent amount of shares at the price of TCNNF at the time of the announcement,  at the time things finalize? Something else? 

If TCNNF price tanks between now and then,  could this potentially be a loss instead of this estimated premium? 


Any help explaining this is greatly appreciated. 

For disclosure,  i have approx 5k shares of HRVSF. long on weed industry,  not necessarily on TCNNF. This is my first merger/ acquisition I've had skin in the game with,  so using this current example instead of a hypothetical.

No matter what data you’re looking at in the past year. They’ve not taken a lose once. No one can say when this winning streak will come to an end. However with the demand for construction sky rocketing. One can only speculate, it won’t be anytime soon. This is largely due to COVID restrictions being lifted as well as Biden’s infrastructure bill.

Now let’s focus a little on the infrastructure bill aspect. There’s a lot of speculation which companies will benefit the most from this. Though trying to pinpoint who’ll be the lowest bidder is close to impossible. So let’s focus on what we know for a fact. No matter what construction companies get the contracts, one thing remains. They’re gonna need a lot of supplies for the job. That’s where TEX the glorious Terex shines.

Its price was largely flat and boring for this year, so the 10-12% jump in price looks sort of unusual.

1. S&P tanks and I'm fully invested in a downturn 
2. Multiple Potential wash sales triggering but I could always sell in November and stay away for 31 days if I believe this would be an issue.

Submission,nsdwq4,[$Wish: Contextlogic] : DD for an undervalued company with huge upside potential,UnfairWorldliness426," As you may see, this is not a financial advice, it's just some work that I did to justify to my wife why I did what I did. hoping this will not be the main reason for our divorce.

Last week, I have shared my ALL IN position in $Wish, and I got a lot of comments and messages saying it's not a good call, and some of them asking me if I really did some DD or just went ALL IN !

This is not a Finantial advice

Well, I would be happy to share with you some information that I found before my call, because I think this could be a great opportunity for some of you for the next weeks/months. (Thank me later this year)

For the ones who don’t have time to read all the Text, This is the key metrics:

&#x200B;

| **Market numbers** | **Economic numbers** |
|:-|:-|
| Share price : 7.94$ | Q1 sales : 772M (\~3B Annual sales) |
| Market Cap 4.915B | Q1 EPS : -0.21 |
| 52 weekk Range **7.66$ - 32.8$** | Q1 *Revenue Growth Accelerated to 75% Year Over Year* |
| 28-05 Short Volume ration : 24.24% | Average Analysts Price Target: $22.92 |
| Short Volume 5,079,659 Market Volume 20,952,200 | Cash: 2 B |
| Average Analysts Price Target: $22.92 | Mounthly active users : 100 Millions |

 

Technology:

Most people see wish as a simple buy platform. But its way more they have deep learning meaning the company has software that studies the costumers behavior and proposes to them products. This has lead to 70% of sales not being from searches but from the menu.

They use a discovery based menu which is very attractive and also focus on personalized browsing just like tik tok does deep learning at its finest.

They collect data from more than 100 million users every month to personalize the menu even more giving them a very unique advantage. Using data is the key to success here because they use data to get better and more effective ads to maximiaze returns and conversion .

Growth

They grew revenue from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 31% and from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 32% revenue is diversified and global. In 2019, 93% of our revenue was from marketplace services, 84% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 16% of which was from our native advertising tool, ProductBoost, and 7% was from logistics services.

They refer to marketplace revenue, excluding revenue from ProductBoost, as core marketplace revenue. ProductBoost is an advertising feature by which our merchants can promote their listings within user feeds.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 82% of revenue was from marketplace services, 90% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 10% of which was from ProductBoost, and 18% was from logistics services.

In terms of geographic diversification by users, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 43% of core marketplace revenue came from Europe, 42% from North America, 5% from South America, and 10% from the rest of the world growth has been highly capital efficient.

They have been able to achieve this massive growth and scale by having net cumulative cash flow from operations of $16 million from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2020, aided by their positive cash float, where they receive an upfront payment from a user, and remit payment to a merchant a number of weeks later.

Merchants

They are basically the middle man that connects millions of costumers with merchants. They also provide them with value data to help them do more sales and expand even more. Analytics and data is a key part of their business and it should not be ignored

What's is not so great about them

They grew to fast and have some problems with logistics

There have been some serious delays and even packages missing. They will need to use money from going public to solve this matter and get better at serving costumers.

There business model is to expand advertise and get new costumers. But their problems in logistic could cause them problems with visitor retention and i want to see improvements here.

Conclusion and My Point of View :

I'm not hoping that it will be the next amazon probably will not be,but if the management hundle All the challenges and go profitable, this can have huge upside, and even without that, it have already a great upside potential (That's why average target analysts is about 24$).

Still not entered Indian market wich can be huge.

Submission,nrbn5w,Exact Sciences - Future Global Leader in Advanced Cancer Diagnostics,Superchief440,"Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on Exact Sciences today with a buy rating and a $160 price target, which represents more than a 45% premium to the current valuation. Why is Goldman so bullish?

The company's stool DNA test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is poised for growth. Cologuard was recently recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for all adults at normal risk for developing CRC in the 45-49 year age group. This represents 19 million potential new customers for Cologuard, and Cologuard has been shown to be particularly effective as a screening test (high sensitivity and specificity) in this younger age cohort. There are other significant tailwinds for growth in the next 6-12 months, including sales reps (both Exact Sciences and Pfizer reps) slowly returning to doctors' offices as the pandemic wanes, colonoscopy capacity insufficient to handle giant backlog in CRC screening, electronic ordering now online thru EPIC, and patient wellness visits increasing as things get back to normal.

In addition to Cologuard, Exact Sciences' Oncotype DX test for breast cancer patients is standard of care worldwide for treatment decisions for 70% of women with breast cancer to determine whether chemotherapy may be beneficial. Exact Sciences also purchased PFS Genomics recently, and as a result will bring to market a test to determine whether radiotherapy may be beneficial. These tests will spare countless women from suffering from needless chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Exact Sciences surveillance test for hepatocellular carcinoma - Oncoguard Liver - is currently available and will be rolled out in the next 12 to 18 months with data to be released soon and FDA/CMS approval being sought.

Exact Sciences studies for Cologuard 2.0 and CRC blood test underway and expected to cement Cologuard's position as the leading CRC screening test for adults ages 45 and over at normal risk for developing CRC.

Exact Sciences is developing a multi-cancer blood screening test incorporating recently acquired Thrive Early Detection's CancerSeek technology along with it's own DNA methylation technology to create the world's leading multi-cancer screening test. This would obviously be a game changer with a total addressable market of $25 billion plus annually.

Exact Sciences has the technology, scientists, labs, commercial team, and management in place to become the GLOBAL leader in early cancer detection and treatment! I'm very proud to be fully invested in this company, which is leading the fight against cancer by means of early detection. When detected in its earliest stages, cancer is much more survivable (approximately 90% survival rate vs 10% in late stages) which is why early detection is so important.",,,7,t3_nrbn5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nrbn5w/exact_sciences_future_global_leader_in_advanced/,7,0.74,[1622721253.0]

As far as I understand, if I buy 1 call with a strike price of $65 for $12, and the price goes up to $80 tomorrow, I can sell the call for a profit because this now means that I, or someone else, can buy shares at $65 and then be able to sell them for $80.

I feel like I understand options enough but all of the resources I can find online aren't clicking enough.

So would I be right in buying at that strike price?

Or am I off and the strike price is the price that I think the stock will reach? E.g. buy a strike price of $80 while the market price is $65 and if it reaches $80, then I win.

Submission,no6pc3,Is one share of AMZN arguably better than 6 smaller stocks?,Maximum-Fudge6438,"So currently own AMD, ALLY, TGT, PEP, V, SMT (a UK ETF), IAG, DIS, AAPL, MSFT and F to the value of two AMZN shares.

The rest is VWRP (VT equivalent) so not selling that.

Looking to long hold, so aside from the diversification argument is a greater ROI in one share of AMZN over these other companies?

Can actually hold AAPL, MSFT, TGT, DIS and V and stump up the extra few hundred for a AMZN share so really it’s sell off between;

AMD, ALLY, PEP, SMT, IAG, F for one AMZN.

Only own like 2-3 shares of AMD, ALLY, PEP whilst a few more for SMT, IAG and F but only to value of about £2000 so that’s the one AMZN share price. So $3,000.

Be interesting to know of what others might do with these shares for the long hold. Either keep the current portfolio and pay into VWRP or sell off half of the value and keep AAPL, MSFT, TGT, DIS, V and buy AMZN alongside the ETF instead.

Would not want to sell any of those six but is it too tech heavy? Personally think AMZN has the ability to increase share price more over 10 years than AMD, ALLY, PEP, SMT, IAG and F can do combined. The only one of those that could increase a fair bit is AMD but only own 2 shares at a value of £110.

Thanks all for any guidance and whether it’s worth doing.

Could also add GOOGL and AMZN at one share each but then basically own the top companies in S&P alongside a global ETF which top holdings are also those same businesses.

Moving cars to electric will make it easier to make them to use green energy as the power grid hopefully goes more green over time. My question is- why are their stock prices going up when they announce they are going EV? Everyone's going EV and to me it seems more like a requirement to stay relevant and not a sign of bullishness. I have a Kia Spectra from the 2000s- and the reason I'm not getting a new car is not because they arnt EV- It's because I don't need a new car yet (or a new used car let's be real here). That's a personal example but regardless- I don't think going EV is going to increase the demand for cars overall. People need cars when they need cars- EV isn't going to speed up the process. This is my besr case on EV I guess. I've been considering buying long term puts on Ford this past week but I never buy puts- I don't like rooting for failure (joke... kinda)

Submission,nmbc27,LYG - Additional Dividend Opportunity in 2021.,TedsRocks,"
Lloyd’s Bank (American ADR - LYG) released the following statement in their 2021 Shareholder Event call last week regarding the opportunity to pay an additional dividend in 2021 beyond the maximum allowable set by the UK government in response to the Covid crisis. 

“Regarding our dividend. Last year, following a request to all banks by the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Group suspended dividends on ordinary shares and cancelled the final dividend for 2019. These decisions were not taken lightly and I'm sure will have come as a disappointment to you, our shareholders.

However, our capital position has remained strong as a result and, following the PRA announcement in December, the Board was therefore able to recommend a total ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share - the maximum allowable within the PRA guidelines.

We recognise the importance of the dividend to many of our shareholders. The PRA has said that they will consider their guidance on 2021 dividends before banks announce their half-year results, so the Board expects to be in a position to discuss interim dividends when it reviews the performance of the business for the first half of the year. Our position on quarterly dividends will also be confirmed at this time.

The Board remains committed to future capital returns. In 2021, subject to regulatory guidance, the Board intends to grow the dividend from 2020, in line with the Group's progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.”

https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/LON:LLOY/Lloyds-Banking-Group/rns/975557

The Prudential Regulation Authority will release an update to their guidance requiring UK banks to scrap dividends throughout 2020 and 4Q 2019 sometime this summer. Currently a maximum allowable dividend of 0.47p is set for 2021. However the PRA is expected to either increase this amount or allow banks to reinstate unrestricted dividends. Although unrestricted dividends will most likely occur in 2022, the opportunity for additional dividends in 2021 and a large increase in yield beginning in 2022 could be a catalyst for LYG to cross the $3 threshold and touch $4 around the time the updated guidance and dividend plan is released. 

Additional info from Q1 2021:

Submission,nm5h8u,"Inexperienced investor, with 5k cash sitting in an IRA.",Clocktease,"
Hey guys! 
Cards on the table, I know very little about the stock market and how it works. I understand the concept of return on investment, capital gains, high risk vs low risk, etc.

I’m just looking for advice on what I should do with the 5k sitting in “cash investments” for my contributory IRA. It used to be a profit sharing account managed by my old company’s accounting firm, but I quit that job and moved across the country. They originally put 1.2k into Vanguard ETFs, right before the pandemic, which have performed extravagantly well in the past year. I think it’s up something like 45%. 

TLDR; I have 5k waiting to be invested in my IRA already, I just don’t know what to do with it. Are the returns on this ETF unprecedented, or would I be wise to buy up a few more shares expecting it to see more lift? 

I’m not trying to become financially independent right now, I just hate to see cash sitting there losing value every month and am not sure how to amend that.",Advice Request,,35,t3_nm5h8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nm5h8u/inexperienced_investor_with_5k_cash_sitting_in_an/,6,0.88,[1622115503.0]
Submission,nlku8p,"Restaurants, more Bloated than a Pregnant Woman:",minnesotatrans,"  

 

In my life, I have developed a love for Restaurants. The unlimited drinks at a cheap price, the quality boneless Buffalo wings, I love it all. However, there is one thing I have noticed researching Restaurant stocks (starting with my favorite screener, Finviz): many of them are overvalued. Granted, the COVID 19 Disease has plagued and closed many restaurants; so its’ understandable if a restaurant temporarily loses money. However, if a company has little cash, negative cash flow, and a lot of debt, it is likely that the company will either had to get acquired by a speculator, reorganize, or, liquidate. I have three brief case studies that will show you how Restaurant stocks fare in the market.

**First is Dave & Busters (PLAY)**, the Restaurant/Arcade amalgamation that is also noted for their Buffalo wings. The market capitalization for the company is $2.02 billion. In terms of stock price, the company has gone up in price. From $13.23 on August 21, 2020, the company now trades at $42.45. Is it worth it? Let us find out. 

The company’s equity is only $153 million ($169 million in 2020). With long-term debt, PLAY has $596 million in long-term debt. PLAY also has $1.3 billion in operating lease liabilities (which means that PLAY has a lot of rent to pay). In simpler terms, imagine having to pay $1.3 billion for an apartment without leasing it to anyone. The apartment would go out of business. And remember, the company has not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic! 

Current Assets are low for the company compared to their liabilities. PLAY has only $11.9 million in cash, with only $24 million in inventories. The company also lost $49 million in Free-Cash-Flow. Yes, 2019 had a positive of Cash Flow ($288 million), which is a good way to pay off debt. However, it will take a couple of years before the Restaurant business recovers; and cash cannot pay off the debt. The company has an Enterprise Value (Market Capitalization plus Debt minus Cash) of $3.92 billion. Finally, the company trades at over 13 times its’ book value. 

Would you invest into a company with little cash, lots of debt, loss of revenue? Probably not. 

**Second is Potbelly Corporation (PBPB)**. The company is a sandwich shop that is based in the mid-West as well as select cities in states such as Texas. Akin to PLAY, the company has gained a lot in Stock price; going up from $3.50 in November 2020 to its’ current price of $6.97. Is the company worth $193.81 million? Let us find out. 

PBPB, if invested in December 2015, would only be worth $40 in December 2020. By contrast, $100 in the NASDAQ in the same time would be worth over $260 – and that is in spite of the Pandemic. In 2018, the company lost $8.54 million. In 2019, the company lost $23.59 million despite only having $13 million less in revenue (this was due to income taxes). In 2020, the company lost $65.67 million in 2020 due to the Pandemic. 

PBPB only has $11.13 million in cash, and $3 million in inventories. Operating lease liabilities is $35.32 million, wiping out the Current Assets ($23.31 million). Total liabilities are $277.90 million compared to only $283.36 million in assets. PBPB only as $5.5 million in equity; yet, is valued at $193.81 million! Imagine buying $5.50’s worth of Lemonade for $194. Net cash provided by operating activities has gone down from $31 million in 2018 down to $18.17 million in $11.61 million in 2020. 

PBPB’s price is not worth the value. 

**Third and finally is Noodles & Company (NDLS)**

NDLS is exactly as it says in the tine: it sells Pasta meals. I have only been in there once in my life. The market values the company at $559 million. Akin to the other two food companies, NDLS has increased in Price over the past year (from $6.40 on November 2nd, 2020) to $12.34 on May 26, 2021. Is it worth the increase? Let us tune in, turn on, and drop out. 

Since 2016, NDLS has had a loss of net income four times (as high as $71.7 million in 2016) out of five.  With Cash Flows, NDLS has been variable, with last year generating only $9.12 million compared to $30.06 million in 2019. NDLS only has $7.8 million in cash and $9.6 million in inventories. Current Assets are $23.71 million. Current liabilities (including $26.1 million in current operating lease liabilities in 2020) are $58.13 million. In other words, immediate liquidity is impossible. Long-term debt is $41 million. 

NDLS may not be as bad as the other two stocks; but, it still is not worth the increase in stock price that happened this past year.

Prices should (in a perfect world) go up if the value is higher than the price. This is not a perfect world, however, and, the market does not reflect price in value sometimes.

Advice I've gotten has said to buy into the market piece by piece, slowly over time and I've been following it. When it comes to selling I've assumed I'd just sell everything I had in a stock once it went up enough but then I thought ""well what if I sell it off piece by piece"". Specifically I have a +$150 return on 22nd Century Group Inc so I sold $130 worth of it. I figure if it continues to climb sure I'll make a bit less money but if it crashes (which I don't think is likely but you never know) I'll lose less and if it dips but looks like it'll come back up I can use the money from the sale to buy more. I know that sounds like I'm trying to time the market which is foolish but this is motivated more by wanting to actually secure the money I make from my investments rather then watch the money number go up only for it to drop like a rock before I actually get any of it out.

Submission,nkd1hk,"$HTZGQ - PUT ALOT OF WORK INTO THIS DD, FINAL VALUE ESTIMATE",NotanSECgoon," **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

All companies I am invested in seem to be doing okayish business-wise. XOM is still down 10% , some other 30% - but during Corona even the most solid companies droped 40% easy.

Submission,ngsgcn,Frontline - a tanker company that seems to do everything right in the last years,vasesimi," Frontline Ltd., a shipping company, engages in the seaborne transportation of crude oil and oil products worldwide. It owns and operates oil and product tankers. As of December 31, 2020, the company operated a fleet of 68 vessels. It is also involved in the charter, purchase, and sale of vessels.

Starting with a PE ratio of 4 and a PB ratio of 1 is always a good start. But then again most taker companies are now trading at a low PE ratio. Their net income, revenue and profit margin were increasing in the last 3 years which is a really good sign. One not so good sign is their debt which has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 billion in the last 4 years.

You could consider that shipping oil is not a good business anymore because renewables but changing to renewables cannot be done in an instant so the transition will be slow. For example the Chinese oil consumption reached an all time high in December 2020. In the same time a lot of companies have reduced their number of shipping vessels due to the low demand in last year. 

To take something from their SEC filling regarding risk:

“The demand for our oil tankers derives primarily from demand for Arabian Gulf, West African, North Sea, Caribbean, Russian and US Shale crude oil, which, in turn, primarily depends on the economies of the world's industrial countries and competition from alternative energy sources. Any decrease in shipments of crude oil or change in trade patterns from the above mentioned geographical areas would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Among the factors which could lead to such a decrease are:

• increased crude oil production from other areas;

• increased refining capacity in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• increased use of existing and future crude oil pipelines in the Arabian Gulf or West Africa;

• a decision by oil-producing nations to increase their crude oil prices or to further decrease or limit their crude oil production;

• armed conflict in the Arabian Gulf and West Africa and political or other factors; and

• the development, availability and the costs of nuclear power, natural gas, coal and other alternative sources of energy. In addition, volatile economic conditions affecting world economies may result in reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our ability to pay dividends. “

I don’t really know how to evaluate these so I will let you evaluate them. They also say that “If the tanker industry, which historically has been cyclical and volatile, declines in the future, our revenues, earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected.“ which basically means the earnings might go up or they might go down. The same is with the stock price.

Personally I think they will do well at least the next year because the demand for oil is still high, China is running on all cylinders because they need more and more energy, the airlines will start having more airplanes in the sky which will kickstart refineries and until “green solutions“ kick in we will need something.

Submission,nbusuy,What did I do wrong investing in commodities during the inflation?,Undeadltd_SI,"Hey guys, I’m trying to figure out what I did wrong here. Are commodities something we shouldn’t invest in during an inflation?

FYI, I’m new to this, just started last week. When I was looking into what stocks to invest in, I kept reading news about the fear of inflation, which eventually was confirmed yesterday with the CPI report. 

But prior to this, while doing my research and reading about the fear of inflation, I looked up what kind of stocks to invest in during an inflation, and 'commodities' seemed to be a very common answer. 

So looking at companies dealing in commodities, I narrowed my list down to $CLF, $FCX, and $WY. I did see that they were trading at their all time highs at the time, so I read into their outlook, which basically said that given the rise in demand in the commodities they deal in and the bottleneck in supply, these stocks should continue their trend this year. So I got a few call options- 1xCLF 5/21 $20C, 2xCLF 5/28 $22.5C, 1xFCX 5/28 $43C, 1xWY 5/28 $39.5C- all by Monday morning.

Submission,naooit,Electric vehicle Volkswagen embraces lidar for autonomous driving technology - VWAGY and possible IPO of Argo AI,Torlek1,"Tesla has been dismissive of lidar technology for its autonomous technology development.  What has been the result?

[Forget Tesla: Experts Say These 4 Tech Companies Are The Future Of Self-Driving Cars](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/best-autonomous-driving-companies)

> WE WERE PROMISED SELF-DRIVING CARS before the end of the last decade, and those predictions are turning out to be wildly, hilariously wrong. But things may be catching up — and the loser of the pack, according to Sam Abuelsamid of Guidehouse Insights, is Tesla, which may surprise droves of Elon-stans.

And:

> The report specifically calls out Argo’s testing on highways in Miami. “Highway driving capability will enable Argo-powered AVs to expand operating domains to more areas of the regions they serve,” says the report. It does note that Argo AI has not shown off its autonomous tech with public ride testing as Waymo has.

On the other hand, electric vehicle maker Volkswagen is embracing lidar for autonomous driving technology.

[VW Plans to Have Autonomous Microbus Ready for Roads in 2025](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/vw-plans-to-have-autonomous-microbus-ready-for-roads-in-2025-1.1602643)

> Volkswagen AG plans to offer a highly automated version of the hippie-era microbus it’s reviving as an electric van as the carmaker commercializes self-driving technology along with startup Argo AI.

> VW is preparing an ID.Buzz with Level 4 autonomy -- meaning the vehicle can drive itself under certain conditions -- to be ready for commercial transport of people and goods for 2025. It’s testing Argo AI’s technology at six U.S. locations and will expand to a site in Munich this year to further refine the system.

And:

> VW stepped up its efforts in the space when it invested in and teamed with Argo while broadening an alliance with Ford in 2019. Europe’s largest automaker put its van unit in charge of the collaboration, as it’s betting self-driving technology can be rolled out for commercial use in designated areas faster than with passenger cars on public roads.

[VW will start testing its Argo AI-powered self-driving vans in Germany this summer](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany)

> Volkswagen will start testing its new autonomous vehicles in Germany this summer, the company announced Wednesday. The German automaker’s electric ID Buzz vans will use hardware and software developed by Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup that is backed by Ford and VW. The aim is to launch a commercial delivery and micro-transit service in Germany by 2025.

And:

> “We’re building our technology and partnering with Volkswagen in a way that really sets us apart from what others are doing,” [Argo AI CEO Bryan Salesky] said. “And we think it really puts us in a position to deliver a safe, smart, and scalable product to deliver on the promise of autonomous driving.”

2. Huge institutional investors. Well with our amount of money even if you are in the millions you and me - we are screwed. If they fart left and we go right well too bad, we need to wait for a change of wind direction.
3. Logical valuations. That is also within your area of competence. You can read 5-10 years worth of 10Ks and decide if a company suits your methods or not.

That is if you are INVESTING.

There is a HUGE HUGE difference between investing, day trading, swing trading and trading options, investing for growth, investing for value or speculation.

You can't make money long term if you don't know into which group you belong.

I for example am investing my money LONG TERM. Which means even if market dives I take my cash position and I deploy it to make more money in 2-3 years. I reinvest every single dividend for a snowball effect.

I can't understand why people are joining a discussion without having any sort of fundamental information regarding investment strategy from the OP.

Yes we see you red lines, we see your winnings but tell us WHY and what for you are investing. For how long?

IMO every post should being with:

1. I am XYZ type of investor
2. My time frame is XYZ
3. My risk tolerance is low, average, high
4. I am using XYZ method of trading (swing trading, day trading, long term holding)

&#x200B;

We can't have a decent sub without these type of infromation, right now this is a pit where people are dumping their thoughts like shit into toilet without any freaking context.

&#x200B;

So.

The planning part.

1. Ask yourself truly how much can you lose.
2. Ask yourself why are you investing.
3. For how long
4. When to exit. For example if stock is 1-2-3 fold or maybe just after 30% uptick? Have that and then don't cry when you see drop from 178% gain to 13% because you never exited that position. I am for example holding dividend paying stocks, when one of them rises 50% I sell and I put that money into something else or I reinvest to the pie I have.
5. How much can you really add? Are you going to DCA ( dollar cost average)?
6. Throwing around HOLD THE DIP or JUST DCA won't work for people that are in the market for a 3 year timeframe. I can hold a stock for 10 years without a flinch but most people can't.
7. If you are uncertain use a paper account. Most of the notable platforms have a form of trading virtual money. Do it for a year and see if you are not bored already. It's about the process, a journey, if you are in for a short squeeze of time just play option like in a casino and then whine about losing or brag about winning. It's like giving a leash without a dog to a child to see if the child keeps walking out with the leash to make sure it can handle a dog long term.
8. Make sure to be up to date but don't make decisions based on inflation or the interest rate if you are a long term holder. I know that inflation is a bad sing for day/swing traders because their positions and trading strategy will be harder so make sure to read up on that. I don't give a damn about those things, only when I buy.
9. I buy once a year. I reinvest everything automatically to see the snowball but I make one big purchase a year. It gives me time, reliefs stress. I can read 100s of 10Ks before I hit that purchase button because of my investing plan I am stuck with it for minimum 5-10 years so it better be good.
10. Decide if buying 10 stocks for 1000 dollars make sense. IMHO it doesn't. If you work with less then 10K just invest in 2-3 very well picked holdings, it will bring more money from divs and natural growth. If you purchase 15 holdings it doesn't make sense and you won't make a lot of money, you will be frustrated.
11. If you can't invest more at a time work on yourself. Get an MBA, maybe do some certifications. Increase your wage. Don't enter the stock market to make it your main source of income without education. For me it is a hobby that will last a lifetime, for you it may be a chance to actually replace your ""normal"" job. So educate, go to local uni or a course (a good course, not a mentorship). Even if you are 40 and driving a forklift you can go to college and you can get new education. Your family should be supportive about you growing as a human being.

&#x200B;

It really doesn't matter for me what market will do in 3 hours from now, it may be the biggest drop we've ever seen and I don't care. I wait for a moment like that to deploy cash. If you hold options day trade well hats off to you for such a high risk tolerance and congrats on high rewards.

Market is overheated, tech had a huge run but it doesn't mean that we will see a huge correction any time soon. Low rates are balooning the prices. Diversify a little to sleep better. Or not, just make sure you write it down and stick to it.

&#x200B;

Good luck.

Submission,nqo7lr,MRNA in bubble?,pax_developer," 

MRNA current price: $193, all time high as of right now. MRNA price on Jan 1, 6 mo ago: $104.47. MRNA price 15 mo ago (March 13 2020): \~$20. On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 – not bad. But clearly we’re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \[1\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.

This price already seems too high though… depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \[2\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \~75 bil (read: overbought) \[3\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they’re counting on a significant mass of the global population > 1 billion people ( note they have “plans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022”\[2\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a “long term” supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring > 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?

I don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \[4,5\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven’t YET got the vaccine never intend to: “nearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them”. \[6\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA’s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )

And the reason it’s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.

And furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that’s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.

In Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. “The drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country’s supply.” \[7\] This article advocates caution because, at the time “data is scant”. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.

What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \[8\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well – what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \[9\] “Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.” At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \~1,200 healthcare workers, \~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \~800 did. Of the \~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \[10,11\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: “98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \[0.09-0.39\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \[0.09-0.25\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \[0.14-0.42\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \[0.04-0.63\] for early treatment.” \[12,13\]

Remember when India was getting devastated by covid? Seems like yesterday. Where did all that news go? Well, there’s this: many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult…\[14\]. What about Africa? Didn’t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well… a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \[15\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \[16\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.

So what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!

Before I dive head first into selling options contracts I was hoping to get some confirmation on how it works. 

Say I have a 100 shares of $xyz and am bearish on it. I sell covered calls to open and collect the premium. Then if the contract expires worthless that's it. If the buyer choses to excersise I get paid strike price x100.

However if I am bullish on $xyz I would sell a put contract to open at a price I would be willing to buy 100 shares at.  Then I'm paid a premium. Then if $xyz goes up I buy at the strike price and then if it goes down nothing happens and I only keep the premium.

Is any of that off base?  I *think* I get the basics of options trading, but like I said before I jump into selling contracts I want to make sure I fully understand.  I'm perfectly happy to ignore options, as boomer trading the last decade or so has had left me beating the market quite handily.

The dividend will be payable on July 1, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2021.

Like most reddit sheeple I invested in AMC when the stonks short stuff was happening, and I had a few questions about investing in general.  Disclaimer, I also did this with no guidance or general knowledge, so I'm also still relatively clueless of the ins and outs.

I understand if I were to sell stocks within a year of me buying I will be taxed, but if I were to sell it and reinvest into another company would I still be taxed?

And If I were to make a Roth IRA account, would stocks I own be able to be in that account?

I did all of this investing through Vanguard which was told to me is a good option for investing.  And I understand that through vanguard there are a few options of how you invest through a roth ira.

Last question, I recently got a 401k with my new job and I understand that you can fund a roth IRA with a 401k, but how quickly can that happen? I don't know alot about 401ks, but I imagine they take a portion from each check to go towards retirement, and just curious if I can on a monthly basis use that to fund a roth?

Submission,nl4nb1,Discovery + Warner Media from ATT means the stock is worth less? What gives? DISCA was $43 Premarket 5/17/2021 and closed at $30.66?? What?,UltimateTraders,"If there are thoughts both PROS and CONs regarding this mega deal please feel free to comment. I want all the minds on Reddit to try and make some sense out of this....

When this deal was announced May 17th DISCA and T were on fire. Premarket I was watching shares catch fire and go above $43 on DISCA. Later on during the day, I did decide to start trading it as it fell to $34. In my opinion close to $34-35 is a fair value for the stock without a deal!

DISCA now has 15 + million subscribers for their 4.99 service. Expectations were for 8. We all know the streaming is the wave. As we see also with Netflix and Disney there is enough for them all provided we have rich content. In the most recent report DISCA beat on top line and said that the streaming business added 4 million subs in just the last 2 months. This business is alot more profitable. Current bottom line is about 2.79 for the year, next year is about 3.25 without factoring in the rapid streaming and more profitable side of the business. This yields a PE ratio of this year near 11 and next year under 10! Doesn't that sound cheap for a large company that will grow sales between 10-15%?

This is all before the Warner Media deal.... So in my mind DISCA is worth 34-35.... On it's own its executing and turning the business around.....so now with Adult Swim, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, HBO..... now its worth less?

I understand we won't be able to see the full details and synergies yet.... this deal may or may not even close! It will be at least 6 months out.... but in the mean time DISCA which has been delivering is getting crushed? This combines to be close to a 50 billion company...... Unfortunately, T paid over 85 billion, and there is still alot of debt. But please help me figure out how DISCA isnt worth at least 35..... 

Should we just can the deal and fight to stop the merger? Is that what the market is saying? That combining all that and maybe charging 14.99 for HBO and Discovery + and maybe having 100 million subscribers is not good?...... Do we see what it is doing for DISNEY? Just shaking my head here.

Submission,nkrho8,Taxes- Is gain/loss the only thing that really matters when filing?,koberkai,"So here’s the situation. I have been running credit spreads on spy for a while. I am very good with tracking them and making sure to close out if it is unfavorable. A family emergency came about and I was unable to attend to my stocks for two days. I had 10 spy put credit spreads that went ITM at expiry and I was unable to close them out before expiration due to said emergency. A took a net loss of 1000 bucks (which in the grand scheme of things isn’t the worst case scenario but still sucks). 

Two days later, I look at my TD Ameritrade account and it exercised the short and long leg to cover. Because it exercised basically 1000 shares of spy, it shows up as $420,000 cost and $419,000 proceeds. This equals out to 1000 dollar loss. I obviously did not put up that much capital.

My question is, when I go to file my taxes next year, is the only thing I need to worry about is my total net gain/losses for the year?

how do I convince him?

If you were to sell a covered call on SPY 6.07% above the weeks opening price, you should expect to see your shares taken away once every 100 weeks.

Submission,ndoku9,Inflation: timing stocks as an hedge?,mookmook89,"Lots of people are saying stocks are the best hedge against inflation, as companies will absorb costs and raise prices. However, the current S&P yield is around 2%. If central banks raise interest rates to tame inflation, valuation of bonds and stocks will have to ajust to offer a higher yield. So if the 10 year US bond yields reach 3-4%, you can’t justify a 2% yield on S&P considering it’s a riskier asset. So current stocks valuations should fall. But then, when the S&P valuation is adjusted, it would be the perfect timing to buy/hold and hedge against inflation.

TL/DR: wtf is going on with [http://www.buyins.com/](http://www.buyins.com/) \- the site is completely broken, no links work, latest data on the site is from like 2012, HOWEVER they randomly release recent (few days ago) reports... I would be very interested in actually using their services but it's almost impossible to actually interact/use them??

Any insight would be appreciated! I'd pay to use their services if they are actually usable...

Longer explanation:

\- I was reading a [Yahoo finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huge-naked-short-helium-explorer-144300407.html) saying ""*...Buyins.com, which allows companies and investors to see what’s really going on in the markets--recently put out a* [*shocking report*](http://www.buyins.com/news/avnnews5-10-21.pdf) *on Avanti...*"" (the ""shocking report"" link works btw - good read)

\- Immediately interested, I go to their website (check it out yourself). Almost ALL links are broken, latest dates are from years ago etc.

\- HOWEVER, doing some google searching, they do arbitrarily put out reports (very recent). My question is WTF is going on with their website/services. I am pretty much saying ""take my money!"" :) but can't figure out what this company is doing (vis-a-vis their online presence)

Submission,ncfhh5,Portfolio Distribution for Retired People?,beautifulnamja,"A friend's mom is 72. Probably has another 10-20 years left in her. No health concerns other than type 2 diabetes, and no hospitalizations have occurred from it. Not obese and fairly active.

She has $50K cash sitting in a low-yield savings account. Her goal is to probably give money to her 3 kids when she dies as she's able to get by from social security and her birth country's pension (dual-citizenship).

Subreddit wikis just talk about pre-retirement portfolios.

Obviously her risk tolerance is low as she's old, so she'd ideally want her portfolio to be conservative, but with yields higher than your average high-yield savings account or CD.

Also would like to have a simple portfolio similar to the 3-fund portfolio strategy.

I was thinking:

* (50%) Index tracking total stock market mutual fund or an S&P 500 ETF
* (30%) Bonds
* (20%) Dividend Stocks + REITs

Submission,ncege4,Retirement plan,LuqmaisteR,"Long story short, I was talking to one local multi-millionaire and he told me the story behind his fortune when he was a bit tipsy. He's in his 60s. So, this guy claims he never was really the wealthiest guy out there, quite the opposite he was working hard to survive from month to month like most people, saving some small amounts of money to buy himself a car or house over the years. I was actually amazed because everyone knows that at the moment he's a multi-millionaire, so I asked him directly how is this possible that he's a millionaire if he never really got any fortune in his life, and that was the moment he told me   
'son, you're still young, I'll give you the advice I've had got from one of my late old friends back day. Put $100 on stocks every week, that's it. That's not much, you won't even feel it missing, but over the years your money will be stacking, and be growing over the years. That's how I became a millionaire after cashing it a few years ago.'   
He said that he invested in some copper company.  


This leads to a few questions:  
1) is such a strategy really worth it?  
2) if so what companies are worth putting your money into long term?  
3) should I go on the market alone \[via robinhood\] or perhaps use some investment groups?

These chips power our electronics, many of which are now being used in vehicles. In short, some of the auto industry plants are shutting down bc there aren't enough chips to continue building the cars. so, in my line of thinking some of the auto industry stocks' are going to fall bc they are losing money. This is also making the price of cars soar and people on a budget will probably just wait it out to buy since this is supposed to be over by 2022. So the auto industry is losing money in more than one way. For instance, Honda is already undervalued but if this chip shortage continues the stock could fall further and become very undervalued.

Submission,nabmln,Auto stocks seem to be riding too high on the EV hype,bighomiej69,"I feel like Tesla sunk it's teeth into a niche market of luxury electric cars that appear futury. But the allure of having a Tesla in my opinion is that they are different and unique, not necessarily that they are electric. They are like the Macbooks of cars.

Now I get creating an affordable electric car, and marketing it as a cost saver in gas and maintenance, but I believe trying to compete with Tesla in their little market of cyberpunk LARPERs is suicide. As an example... Ford just announced an electric f-150. As far as I know, there are two kinds of people who own f-150's: 

1) Blue collar workers who's only consideration in buying a truck is that it does the job for as cheaply as possible, they could care less if it's with a gas or electric truck.

2) People who want to compensate for their fragile masculinity by driving the biggest, most noisy, gas guzzling, obnoxious atmosphere killing vehicle they can get their hands on. In which case, electric might be a negative if anything. 

GM seems to be throwing all of their eggs into the electric vehicle hype. They are planning on transition all their vehicles to electric by 2035.

Now, one thing I understand about the auto industry is that it's a nightmare of a business to be in and the margins are terrifyingly slim. Macro economic variables can still punish them severely even if they do everything right. If they make a mistake? Like overestimating the market for expensive electric vehicles and spending a fortune on creating the capabilities to manufacture them? I mean it's not even really outside the realm of possibilities that they go bankrupt over something like that. 

I'm not bearish on auto companies, I just don't see anyone talking about the risk, they seem to jump every time they announce an EV. EV's have a lot of potential, but I don't see a huge demand for them. The vast majority of people, as you can see by how tightly car sales correlate with macroeconomic trends, seem to just think of cost when they buy a car, they just buy whatever is the best deal they can find. The rest who buy luxury vehicles seem to think of them as a fashion statement.

Submission,ntbhea,Amazon and Facebook to fall under new G7 tax rules - Yellen,Karnes,"'Both Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook (FB.O) will fall under new proposals for a global minimum corporation tax agreed by the Group of Seven on Saturday, United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.

Asked whether the two companies would be covered by the proposal, Yellen said: ""It will include large profitable firms and those firms, I believe, will qualify by almost any definition.""

The joint statement by G7 finance ministers earlier on Saturday said it would tackle tax avoidance by ""the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises"".

Amazon has lower profit margins than most other tech companies, and European countries had been concerned it would escape extra taxation under initial U.S. proposals to the G7.'

When it comes to capital gains taxes, how would it work in this scenario? I'm trying to make sure I'm right before I explain this to my friend:

Would I pay no taxes since I put in $100 and then sold enough to get back that $100 and technically made ""no profit or loss""? 

OR would I have to compare the price of 0.5 shares when I first bought the stock ($50) to the price of 0.5 shares now ($100), which would mean I made a $50 profit and should therefore get taxed on that?

Submission,nsy1tt,"Question about selling calls, where does the obligation of providing the shares go?",Mrsum10ne,"I apologize if this is a common/repeated question, but I haven’t been able to get a solid answer. 

As I understand, trading options can be very risky, so I am a ways off before I’m comfortable doing so. I’m really just trying to understand how they work right now. 

 I’ve heard about selling your call options but I’m not sure how it works. Let’s say I bought a call through my broker (I’m using Robinhood, might change soon). I know I have the right but not obligation to buy 100 shares at the strike price at/before my expiration. Who is the entity that has the obligation of providing those shares? Is it Robinhood, or just who ever wants to take the risk of selling shares at a loss? For the next part of the question I will refer to this original seller as person A. 
Now, let’s say my call goes in the money. But I don’t want to buy thousands of dollars worth of shares. The only reason I’d be in this situation is that I’ve heard I can sell calls, so lets say I sell it to person B (person, entity, whatever). But as it is I don’t have 100 shares in my possession. Am I now obligated to sell person B 100 shares if they decide to exercise the call, or is person A (who sold me the contract originally) still obligated? 

I’ve been researching but haven’t got a straight answer. From what I’ve read, this would be considered selling a naked call, but I am not sure if that is accurate because I understood naked calls as I am person A in my example, but I don’t have 100 shares at the time of selling the option. I’ve also heard of selling to close, which I think is the situation I’m describing but I’m also not sure exactly what happens to the option and how money is earned from that. So can anyone explain if I can sell call contracts, and how that works. Also anywhere I can read more about this type of situation would be good too.",Industry Question,,14,t3_nsy1tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nsy1tt/question_about_selling_calls_where_does_the/,6,0.76,[1622906480.0]

Any advice for how to avoid that? My hope was that the trailing stop loss order would let me purchase the stock at its current price, and then automatically sell it off if it falls more than 1% after the purchase. But in this case, I ended up buying stocks for more than they were ever worth, and the trailing stop loss didn't do anything even if they fell more than -1% after purchase.

To me it seems like they're Slack is going to be a huge step forward into Microsoft's space and I'm excited to see the competition intensify.


That being said, Salesforce is a less complete solution than what Microsoft has to offer in terms of collaboration tools, and products like Atlassian are too expensive. I've noticed that Microsoft and Atlassian both have product management tools and developer repository tools like GitHub and Bitbucket.

I'm concluding that there is a strong possibility that Slack may acquire companies like Monday.com, who have files for IPO this may, and possibly a company like Digital Ocean.

The prices seem to be nearly identical as well as the trends (at least when comparing the stocks of the same companies on yahoo finance, Apple for example).

Submission,nm5s7u,"For larger market ETFs, is there a downside to higher volatility other than the emotional burden?",hawara160421,"I don’t have the guts for highly speculative plays but I’m trying to be more rational about volatility. The two major risks with high volatility I see are the following:

* For individual stocks, option/leverage plays, actively managed funds, or crazy unpredictable stuff (bitcoin, etc), the risk is it jumping to zero or at least a very low bottom it never gets out of.
* For market-wide index ETFs, it increases the negative swings, so in case of a crash a more volatile fund might drop 60%, a less volatile one only 30%. If you, for whatever reason, need that money in times of a downswing and have to sell, you’re losing out.

The latter, IMO, can be outweighed by even higher upward swings if you’re thinking long-term (10+ years). If we're talking 20 years, the NASDAQ 100 beat the S&P 500, even if you entered at the peak of the dot com bubble. It just took 15 years or so.

I have a concrete example. I’m not from the US, so world-market ETFs are more interesting to me and I’ve been looking at the returns of two specific examples:

iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc)

iShares Edge MSCI World **Momentum Factor** UCITS ETF (Acc)

Both track the MSCI but the latter adds a [momentum factor](https://www.msci.com/eqb/methodology/meth_docs/MSCI_Momentum_Indexes_Methodology_June2017.pdf). That sounds a bit scary to me but the results are [convincing.](https://i.imgur.com/9eJ0lfE.jpg) If I started in 2014, the March 2020 low would still be higher than that of the non-momentum index. [Here’s a chart going all the way back to 2007](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/904e031c-94e4-4dbc-a314-7c373446dffa) and it doesn’t look bad, either.

I haven’t found charts going further back, so I wonder, for example, what would have happened during the dot com bubble (for reference: The current highest holding in the momentum index is Tesla with a PE ratio of 620). But I don’t see how it would have been drastically different and it would have swung out of dot com shit within 6 months back then.

I’m trying to be careful so: Am I missing something? To me it seems that for *almost* the same risk, I get *much* better returns long term with the momentum factor.",ETFs,,1,t3_nm5s7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nm5s7u/for_larger_market_etfs_is_there_a_downside_to/,5,0.79,[1622116657.0]

Submission,nlki22,Rookie with stocks - Interested in long term investments,housemountainer,"Question: How do I find out where to invest, when I have an idea in which branche I want to invest?


Story: So I have recently decided, I want to eat way less - to no meat and therefore had a lot of exposure with plantbase food and alternatives. I read some articles about this topic and I am now convinced, that the market for plant base food could have a bit of potential. 

Not just because vegetarien-diet is in the uprise, but because the alternatives get better and better (imo). This makes them a direct competition to the meat industry in long term, since the taste will no longer be a major differentiator in the future. 

I mean I am far for an expert and would not give my arguments too much weight , but I kind of want to be invested in one, or a few companies, that are in this branche.

I really have not thought about writing in this subreddit and just went with a stock i randomly read about. This was kind of a mistake i guess, because I invested in this stock, and since then it lost 70% of its value.

Submission,nl8xqa,"Lithia Motors ($LAD), just killin' me in the middle of DD",Yo_Biff,"I started looking at Lithia Motors ($LAD) in the past couple of weeks.  They're an automotive retailer here in the states with a Market Cap of $10.37b.  Their growth is in main accomplished through M&A of other dealerships.  

* Downsides include: 
   * susceptibility to economic downturns, 
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2020 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
* Fundamental Numbers:
   * Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
      * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%.
   * From 2010 to 2020
      * Revenue grew from $2b to $13.1b (CAGR 20.5%).
      * BVPS CAGR was 24.7% (2020 BVPS of $111.83).
      * EPS CAGR was 43.7% (2020 EPS of $19.53).
      * ROE in 2020 was 25.6% (CAGR 19.2%)
   * Total Debt in 2020 was $4.175b
   * Long-term debt was $2.311b 
   * LT Debt to Earnings = 4.92

The last few numbers are very concerning to me.  That's a whole lot of debt they are carrying!  Combined with limited economic moats.... Hmmmm.  However, I did compare their 2020 numbers to Carmax, one of their biggest competitors.  Carmax had a whooping LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52.  Carmax's growth number were also much less overall.

Given their LT debt/Earnings was roughly 1/4 of a direct competitor's and their growth numbers were looking good to me, I was continuing to do some reading and research.  Then Lithia made a rather big announcement.  They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b.  At the same time they announced a private offering of $800 million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029...  Nearly another billion in LT Debt?!?!?  ARRGGHHHHH!

Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish.  Those plans are as follows:    

* Internal Investment & Modernization 25% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%) 
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%) 
* Dividends 5% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%) 
* Acquisitions 65% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%) 

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues.  They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  However, with the debt now I feel like the research rabbit hole has gotten a little deeper for me....

I suppose the silver lining is that the 2 valuations of the company I ran and margin of safety puts them outside of my current buy range.  So I've got the time for the research.

Submission,nfojgb,How are you investing for this overvalued market?,CaptainCrypto,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to investing in stocks, and would really appreciate your help.

I keep hearing how the current market is likely to be overvalued and all signs are pointing to a bubble. Analysts are warning it could be worse DotCom bubble, etc, with companies propped up on stimulus money despite the troubles of Covid. Apparently Warren Buffet and others have all suggested we will soon see a bear market, but it's impossible to know whether that will be next week or 2030.

With that in mind, my current strategy is value investing for a 1 to 2 year window. I'm looking for massively undervalued stocks (currently my main pick is VIAC) and putting my money there, with the idea that they will outperform the indexes when the dip happens in future.

After the dip, I'd love to go long-term and buy the SNP, chuck in some AAPL and MSFT and some electric car ETFs, but I'm worried if I do that now the arse will fall out of this thing and I'll be left buying at the top of a collapsed market.

Submission,nek5vq,MYOV - Back To Back Catalysts,awoketaco,"Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I’m not a financial advisor. 

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment* 

&#x200B;

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe  

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)  

By July 1:  Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application  

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant.  Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner  (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** 

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

**Positions**: 22.5k shares, 275 calls (mostly leaps).",Company News,,0,t3_nek5vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nek5vq/myov_back_to_back_catalysts/,6,0.8,[1621267508.0]

So where does the money go when the market turns bearish? Is there any empirical evidence beyond ""Scared money buys gold.""

Submission,nbn5h0,Ameritrade flagged sale as a wash trade when I never bought back in,CCChristopherson,"I’ve done a ton of research and am at a loss, so I’m going to try here.

I bought 50 shares of a stock starting January 11 and then purchased 40 more on February 10, which was my last purchase date.  I sold 40 shares on March 8, which is the only time I ever sold. I technically lost 1,049.80, but the wash sale rule was triggered and that amount was added to my cost basis. 

I called into Ameritrade in March asking for an explanation. The customer service rep said it was a standard wash sale violation and I was confused but figured I was missing something so I took him at his word. 

After doing more research I called back in April and the rep said it was absolutely a mistake by Ameritrade and the wash sale rule should not have been triggered because I never bought back in. He said it would be fixed within 2 weeks. It had not been fixed as of today, so I called back and was told that it actually was a wash sale. The rep said he was not aware prior to looking into it that what I did could trigger the wash sale rule, but it technically was one. I asked if that meant that you can never sell at a loss within 30 days of purchasing a stock without triggering the wash sale rule, and he said yes. I told him I’d do more research and call back if I still thought Ameritrade made a mistake.

At this point I’m not sure what to do. I’m not really concerned about the money but I refuse to believe that buying and selling at a loss, without ever buying back in, is a wash sale. 1 of 3 Ameritrade reps agrees with me. The other says this is the first time he’s ever heard of this rule. Does anyone have any insight on what I’m missing?

Submission,nbgkza,Thoughts about WISH?,Infinite_Prize287,"I started buying around $15-16, which is my average, have been averaging down. It's a small portion of my portfolio. I thought that the revenue growth was good (75% y/y), revenue increase per active user was good (76% increase), y/y user growth was between 10-19%, APP reviews on Google play are 4.6/5 with 12mil reviews.  I read the ER transcript, it sounds like corporate is expanding even more into Emerging Markets but still using a lot of capital for growth and advertising. They don't have a lot of debt at all, compared to free cash flow and revenue. Price to sales looks really attractive for a growth company too. Seems like theyve made changes in corporate for the better as well.

My thesis has been mostly that this is a highly utilized platform and while I know that the products and customer service and pricing can be/are dodgy, PEOPLE LOVE CHEAP STUFF. People will buy something just because it's cheap.

Submission,nax03r,"Need help understanding oil, and how to play it in the market",fatboywonder12,"I was never a fan of oil stocks, would rather play with green energy stocks, but I think it's important to get to know every sector, and with recent events, maybe I could make some profit instead of bleeding through my stupid stock picks, or trying to fight UVXY.

That being said, I need to understand more, and I was hoping for my questions to be answered on here. Take note, as you can guess from my questions, I know nothing about the field. The chart i'm using for oil is here [https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/)

So here are my general questions for oil:

**- If oil prices rise/drop, what happens to oil stocks? My guess is if oil prices increase, certain stock prices, such as $USO increase along with it. Is it bad if oil prices increase? Right now the price is at $65. If it goes to $66, what would happen to $USO, and what would happen to a gas company, such as $BP?**

**- What should i be looking for in terms of news relating to oil, and what type of catalysts can cause an increase in an oil stock's price, or more importantly (to me) a decrease in an oil stock's price?**

**- What stocks, outside of gas companies, oil rigs, and anything that produces/distributes oil, is heavily reliant on oil?** 

**- The Biden administration has made it clear that they are trying to steer the US into ""green"" energy. What does that say for the near future for oil/oil companies?**

Submission,naw5am,$CREG my value play,tfam2020,"I've been looking for a deep value play for a while and after reading the little book of value investing and applying practices covered within the book I came across this diamond.

The company began operations as a microbrewery of beers in 1980. On August 6, 2004, it changed its name from Boulder Acquisitions, Inc. to China Digital Wireless, Inc., marketing in pager and mobile phone distribution until May 10, 2007, when the company completely ceased these businesses. In December 2006, the company extended its business to the energy saving and recycling industry. On March 8, 2007, it finally changed its name to current China Recycling Energy Corporation.

The company manufactures various energy-generation projects from the byproducts of industrial processes, such as blast furnace top gas recovery turbine (TRT) unit (using exhaust pressure and heat emitted from industrial processes), waste gas power generation (WGPG) systems, combined cycle power plant (CCPP) systems; biomass power generation systems (BMPG); and wate heat  power generation (WHPG) systems.

The company has a strategic cooperation agreement for three-year exclusive support in business development with CGN Energy Service Co., Ltd. The subsidiaries of the company are: Sifang Holdings, Huahong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Huahong) and Shanghai TCH ( with three subsidiaries: Xi’an TCH Energy Technology Company, Ltd (Xi’an TCH) and Xingtai Huaxin Energy Tech Co., Ltd. (Huaxin), and Xi’an TCH’s subsidiary Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd (Erdos TCH)).

In October 2011, China Recycling Energy Corporation completed an acquisition of a 12-megawatt biomass power generation system from Shenqiu Yuneng Thermal Power Co., Ltd.

In June 2011, the system of the project ZhongBao was sold to and leased back from Cinda Financial Leasing Co., Ltd

As a future play, personally as I see resources drying up and coal and oil being phased out. The world is still not in a full position for the transition fully over to solar, wind and tidal technologies. Therefore technology such as biomass energy generation from the burning of recycled waste is a viable option which creates a use for waste accumulating on landfill sites and can help provide the transition from fossil fuels and provide energy for the installation of green infrastructure.

As a value play; $CREG is currently trading at a price to book ratio of 0.2 that states that this company has 5 times more cash on hand in assets than it is currently trading at on the stock market.

It has a current ratio of 2.67 which shows that it can pay its short term debts off 2.67 times over with current cash on hand.

The company currently has $92,000,000 worth of assets and if we looked at cash per a share this stock is at $24.59 it is currently trading at $7.90 as we speak so if you want to 3x in the next year this is a deep value play.",Company Discussion,,0,t3_naw5am,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/naw5am/creg_my_value_play/,4,0.67,[1620845131.0]
Submission,nakoj6,Softbank Earnings (3.3 P/E),Mad_Nekomancer,"I was taking notes while I was listening but I can't type fast enough to transcribe everything. I'll skim through and post the highligts.

47 billion usd net income, including one-time gain from selling sprint etc.

200 to 236 billion usd increase in NAV (including debts) over 12 months

Breakdown of net asset value: 47% BABA, 25% SVF1+2, 32% other

269 billion usd equity value of holdings, 34 billion usd net debt, 12% loan to value (25% expected in normal times)

12 months ago they announced 2.5 trillion jpy on share repurchases, and 4.5 trillion jpy monetization strategy. Ended up doing 10 trillion jpy in monetizing [includes pending Arm deal], today 2.5 trillion jpy share buyback was completed, and will be retired from treasury.

2.7k jpy EPS in last year [TSE shares, not OTC], NAV is 15k jpy/share, 9.3k jpy/share [actual price]; 3.3 P/E, so it's still undervalued on paper.

1 year ago SVF -1.116 billion jpy quarterly loss, last quarter 3.590 billion jpy quarterly income from svf. Last 12 months 6.358 trillion jpy gain from SVF.

Of the companies that have gone public from the portfolios; SVF1 originally invested 15.7 billion usd, not worth 60.4; SVF2 invested 1.6 billion usd, now worth 6.2 billion.

SVF1: 60% of gain in value went to Softbank Group, because 40% of equity is outside investors with preferred shares and fixed return. SBG had 39% return on net equity annualized (IRR). SVF2: was all SBG capital, 30 billion usd used, 119% IRR. Latam Fund: 2.6 billion usd invested, now 4.0 billion fair value, net equity IRR 62%. 244 total investments across all 3 including deals pending closings.

Companies fluffed: Nvidia, Gopuff, Better, Jellysmack, Trax, Jobandtalent

Important notes from Q&A:

No change in strategy with BABA, so probably mostly holding as Masa sees no fundamental changes in it as a business and it makes plenty of money. Notes that Mapbox deal with SVF unmentionable company is not announced yet (didn't comment on it specifically) but saw no problem with Softbank unmentionable companies merging with SVF portfolio companies. No expectation of doing more share buybacks, implies he would allow share price to fall further below book value of assets and focus on investing. Wants to focus on systemic approach to investing to exiting companies and create more regular pipeline so more steady revenue going forward. Says SVF2 money can be recycled easily and a 3rd party investor is not necessary, happy with amount of capital available. Downplays worries about risks of technology regulation, says he is focused on unicorns not megacaps.

My take: fundamentals are good. Investors are not going to like that he no longer plans to commit to share buybacks. I'd expect the share price to fall a fair bit medium term. Masa implied high levels of confidence on BABA and Arm deal to NVDA which are the 2 big question marks right now.",Company News,,1,t3_nakoj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nakoj6/softbank_earnings_33_pe/,4,0.84,[1620812141.0]

Hi all,

I've been a lurker and got some nice ideas form here, so thanks for that. Now it's the time for me to give something back.

I discovered in the weekend that Magnachip is being bought up in a 29$ per share deal while the price of the stock is just 24$ per share. ([https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/](https://www.magnachip.com/magnachip-enters-into-definitive-agreement-with-wise-road-capital-in-a-take-private-transaction-valued-at-1-4-billion/))

The deal has a definitive agreement and ""The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals"". Also ""The transaction is fully backed by equity commitments and not contingent on any financing conditions. ""

The way I see it it's a 20% win in less than 6 months (they said second half of the year, so most probably will be sometime September-October-November). The risks are small:

Shareholders might oppose- but this is highly unlikely given the company is 78% own by institutions and the board of directors approves the deal.  
Regulatory things might kick in: this again I think it's low because we are talking about a 1 bil company, not something the size of ARM.

But i was wondering what is the general relationship gasoline prices have with its futures?

Reason why i ask is because all these articles referring to the shutdown keeps using keyword such as ""jumped"". Yet oil futures are only up 1% in these articles.

Submission,n7bqw5,The perfect portfolio anxiety.,shortyafter,"***TL;DR*** *- The anxiety that comes with putting a lot of your hard-earned money on the line, especially when you're new to this.  Consider this something of a vent and me sharing my thoughts.  I think it's a good read but hey I'm biased.*

Hey guys,

I want to share about one of the emotional issues of investing that I'm sure many of you can relate to, even if it's not talked about much around here.  I wasn't sure about sharing this, but I figured I would because I think it's important, important for me, and like I said, I imagine for others, too, even if we don't usually talk about it.

I've been investing in a Roth IRA for a few years now, but this February marked my first foray into more extensive investing.  I was sitting on a lot of cash thanks to stimulus, less consumption thanks to Covid, and other reasons, and decided now was the time to put it to work.  I got into individual stocks because of GME.  Sometimes I'm kind of ashamed to say it, because there seems to be a negative stigma attached to that, and you know what? I understand why: the meme stock thing can be anywhere from facepalm to totally cringeworthy.  I share that opinion in some ways.  But at the same time I think that moment brought a lot of young folks into the market who actually have taken the time to learn about it and get serious, and I think that's wonderful.

February 2021 was a bad time for a lot of us to get into the market, because a lot of us tried chasing performance in things like ARK funds.  I understand a lot of people got nailed.  Luckily, I was cautious about getting in tech after such a crazy bull run, and I started out quite defensively.  I haven't lost money yet.  I'm slightly up.

But man, I've rebalanced... twice now.  I mean, the initial portfolio, then a complete overhaul, followed by another complete overhaul today. There's been innumerable minor tweaks and adjustments along the way, too.  In theory, my allocations have gotten better as I've gone along.  My second portfolio definitely made more sense than my first, but after this last readjustment I'm left thinking ""what the hell did I even bother to change for?""   What I have now isn't bad, I think, but I'm not sure it's really better than what I had before.  It might even be worse.  I'll have to chew it over a bit.

That's the thing.  Honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed.  I could just make a rule ""alright, what's done is done"", but that's not the best idea, either.  Sometimes things do change.  Sometimes there are better plays.  We learn and what not.  So I don't feel comfortable making a rule about not making any changes, and if I did make a rule, I'd probably break it anyway.

I don't know what to do anymore.  Totally clueless.  Go back to the old allocation?  Keep things as they are?  Wait and see?  I'm leaning towards wait and see.  Just get this stuff of my chest.  Ride the market a little more and keep an open mind.

It's the uncertainty that kills me, man.  Can I afford to bet a good portion of my money on the entire market (ie: VTI?)  Would it be better to hold cash right now?  What about inflation?  How about individual stocks? What if my pick underperforms or goes bankrupt?  There's always black swan events.  And what about my future?  Where will I be in 10 years?  I wish I had all the answers, but I don't.  Nobody knows.  And that can be frustrating.

One last note.  I know people are going to say ""just do index funds and be done with it"".   I already do them - that's all I have in my Roth IRA.  They're a wonderful idea; I get why people love them.  That said, the portfolio I'm talking about here is in a taxable account and it's money I may need in the mid-term.  I'm young, and my future is uncertain.  I don't know if I'm going to need to buy a house soon, or a car, or go back to school.  I have a job but the pay isn't anything to write home about, and it's not necessarily something that I'll be able to do until I retire.  I think a lot of young people can relate.

Yes, I've got my 6-12 months in cash, and I've even got a tier 2 savings fund in series I bonds (inflation protected, check 'em out).  But still.

I don't want to just sit on cash, especially since cash sucks right now.  I want to put that extra money to work, and make some returns, even if they're modest. But at the same time I don't want my whole portfolio to go crashing down 50% suddenly.  I lost the link, if someone has it please let us know, but there's this great website that shows you how your portfolio (in dollar value, not actual allocations) would have been affected in different crashes (dot com bubble, 2008, etc.)  In 2008 a portfolio would decline over 50%, IIRC, and it would take 5 years and 5 months to recover.   Great, right?  Buy and hold.  Long-term time horizon.

Yeah, that's acceptable if you're 30 years old and saving for retirement.  But for me, it's absolutely unacceptable if I need that money to put a down payment on a house in the next 3-5 years.  You see?

I wish people would be a bit more open-minded when it comes to constantly recommending index funds.  Like I said, I think they're a wonderful idea - probably the best for retirement.  But at the same time every case is different, and every market is different.  Totally wonderful to recommend them, but maybe the downvoting and criticism needs to be cut back a bit.  Dialogue would be nice.  Comprehension. Not everyone has the same goals, needs, or time horizons.  We're all learning here, and nobody has the definitive answer for anyone's financial situation, especially not for yours.

Anyway, that's all guys.  Love to hear your thoughts, feelings, and feedback.  All the best and good luck to everyone.",,,15,t3_n7bqw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/n7bqw5/the_perfect_portfolio_anxiety/,3,0.62,[1620429254.0]

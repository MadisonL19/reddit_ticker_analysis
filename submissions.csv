Submission,me6ezj,Drinking and Trading don’t mix. I accidentally bought equity warrants instead of ordinary stock. How do I make money of of this mistake?,CostantlyLost,"Title says it all. Had a few too many drinks of liquid courage and bought 50 shares of Cresco Labs Equity Warrants (CRLWF) instead of the ordinary shares (CRLBF). I used Fidelity to buy the shares resulting in a fee of $100 (bought 30 and then 20 and didnt notice the $50 fee for each.) So my cost basis is around $8 while the listing price for CRLWF is around $6. 

If I sell now, I get hit with another $50 transaction fee, plus lose the $100 and some change. The warrants expire in September of 2022. The strike price is around $9.90. 

Is there anyway I can come out of this by either breaking even or making a profit? I’m pretty confused about how to exercise warrants, and how people even make money of equity warrants. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

And no need to call me a moron....i’m very well aware if that. Thank you again!",,,208,t3_me6ezj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/me6ezj/drinking_and_trading_dont_mix_i_accidentally/,1298,0.95,[1616818448.0]
Submission,me2d54,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 26, 2021. (Sorry for the late post)",psychotrader00," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.

For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge – rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank's 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months “is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency.""

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

**Highlights** 

* U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. 
* Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan
* WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019. Japanese bank Softbank remains the company’s largest backer.
* NIO became the latest carmaker to temporarily suspend production on Friday as a result of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has led to major problems for car manufacturers across the world.
* The Federal Reserve said that temporary restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most banks on June 30 -- subject to how the banks fare during the annual stress tests. Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning, premarket, and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* Alliance Data Systems (ADS) target raised by Morgan Stanley (MS) from $105 to $150 at Overweight. Stock currently around $112

Submission,me8kb3,5 Considerations When Picking Stocks for Long-Term Growth,MinnesotaPower,"Like many of you, I started actively investing a year and a half ago. The recent rotation was a rude awakening for me because it specifically impacted growth, tech, and renewables (the majority of my holdings).

I have since taken on a cautiously aggressive strategy of picking individual stocks that pass five tests. I wanted to run my theory by this group to hear your thoughts. Note, I’m not trying to find deep value stocks or ten-baggers or anything – just solid doers that have a good chance of outperforming the market for many years to come.

**Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?**

Think of getting your driver’s license photo taken. When I most recently renewed my license, I had a huge beard, and now I’m stuck with that photo for most of my 30s. Of course you don’t need to hold a stock that long. But I think it’s a good framework for analyzing stocks, because they really should be longer term investments. Is this a company that will still be doing well in six years? Can I take myself seriously holding this for that long?

**Test 2: What’s the P/E ratio?**

Nothing new here. But it’s usually the next thing I consider. 12 to 24 great. 25 to 34 understandable. 35-49 caution. 50+ or negative, too speculative.

**Test 3: Did it already moon?**

This was an oversight with one of my original picks. The stock had been trading in the teens in 2019 and was around $100/share when I first bought it. Averaging down is no fun. If a stock mooned anytime in the last 5 years, you might have to accept you missed the ticket. Check 10, 20+ years back for older companies to gain more context.

**Test 4: How linear is its growth?**

Ideally I’d like to see a perfectly straight line over the past 5 years. Something that steadily marches upward over time with minimal volatility, and something that has gained between roughly 125-250% over the past 5 years. While I think lots of companies will do well as companies, I’m hesitant to invest in them if their history looks like a roller coaster. I especially take note of how a company did through 2018-2019, how it did before the Covid crash vs. after, and how it did these past couple months.

**Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?**

Maybe this goes without saying, but I think a company's profitability is a good indication of whether it will do well in the future. It’s nice to see the past 5 earning reports beat expectations, though 4 out of 5 isn’t bad either.

Of course, it’s hard for any stock to pass all five tests, and if I was a purist I probably wouldn’t be very diversified. Some stocks that fit closely with these criteria include UNP, GOOGL, V, HD, DG, TMO, SPGI, and TXN. (This is not financial advice.) Can you think of any others?",Advice,,18,t3_me8kb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/me8kb3/5_considerations_when_picking_stocks_for_longterm/,81,0.87,[1616827758.0]
Submission,me1wx4,"I believe two contradictory things about stocks, and they can't both be true.

I also accept that some stocks are riskier than others.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021.

# **The end of the quarter could create volatility for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/the-end-of-the-quarter-could-create-volatility-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks could be buffeted by end-of-quarter trading in the week ahead, as pension funds and other big investors buy bonds and sell stocks to rebalance their portfolios.
*****
> The dramatic move higher in bond yields this quarter sets up fund managers to shift their holdings, to make up for the shortfall in bond holdings.
*****
> The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy, with the March employment report expected Friday and the White House’s infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday. There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday.
*****
> The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.
*****
> “It’s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Obviously, we’ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They’re trying to figure it out.”
*****
> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.
*****
> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.
*****
> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.
*****
> “It’s in the driver’s seat right now,” said NatWest’s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.
*****
> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.
*****
> “If anything, we’re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,” he said.
*****
> # Infrastructure plan
> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.
*****
> “The Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don’t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,” he said. “If all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I’m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.”
*****
> Gwinn said the market has “fiscal fatigue.”
*****
> “There’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it’s going to be passed, when it’s going to be passed and whether it’s going to be passed ... It’s not tangible enough,” he said.
*****
> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.
*****
> # Rotation
> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.
*****
> “I think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.
*****
> “It’s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,” he said. “I think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that’s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.”
*****
> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.
*****
> “As we’re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,” he said. “To their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy — energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they’re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.

> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month – Up 15 in a Row

> April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.

> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that “work-from-home” stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.

> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April’s performance since 1953. April is DJIA’s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.

> # Historic Year for the S&P 500

> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.

> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**

> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.

> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities

> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.

> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “After likely their worst period in history, although I wasn’t around for the bubonic plague so I can’t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn’t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.”

> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market’s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the “stay at home environment” benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December—even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.

> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.

> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**

> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low – actually it’s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.

> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn’t bad either.

> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals – and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA “Sell in May”).

> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let’s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means “bearish” perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

What exactly does this mean for the stock going forward? Should we expect it to take a hit at all due to these changes? I find it pretty eerie that this news came out right before their upcoming earnings. I’m not sure if today’s dip has had anything to do with this change, but it seems like someone is actively trying to keep this stock down for some reason.

Submission,mdwibp,PLTR - bearish discussion to better understand the company,wsbloverrrrrr,"(Please excuse my username, it's the only account that's not doxxable but I swear this is an actual discussion)

Newbie investor here and been in PLTR since early Nov last year. With the downward trend in the stock's price action, I've been having bearish thoughts on Palantir like (the stock really might be overvalued in PS ratio all that shit) so I'm posting this discussion post so I can get some confirmation bias.

Will list out some bearish topics I've been seeing on blind and other forums regarding pltr. Going to skip talking about their products as there's plenty of materials out there that show how amazingly innovative and advanced Foundry looks

**Share dilution**

So according to their 10-k annual report, they have **1.792 billion** outstanding shares and **743 million** outstanding options (exercisable in the period of multiple years) as of end of 2020, of which **133 million** of them will expire by end of 2022. According to the post I've read, apparently most tech companies (at the time of their respective IPOs) average 10-20% share dilution, mostly in the low 10's.

PLTR will be going through **41%** share dilution. I know share dilution shouldn't affect the company's outlook but this seems pretty severe. What could this mean? Could this mean they got fucked by early investors or is it management being greedy? That doesn't connect though considering they barely sold post-lock up expiry (sold 24 million shares out of 600+ million shares they hold collectively)

**Business focus**

In simplest terms, Palantir seems to focus only on boomer companies/organizations at the moment and don't let businesses to freely try out their products (like letting users create an account and stuff, have to contact them and wait for a response). The lack of trial makes sense, but I'm a little confused on their stubbornness with ""only large companies"". That kind of focus seems to create negatives like years of potentially wasteful sales cycles, customer concentration risks, etc.

Most importantly, they don't advocate for use cases for tech industry (after all, they themselves are a tech company). This [post](https://www.teamblind.com/post/What-makes-Palantirs-business-effective-gunhFsRL) states what I resonate with:

""I could easily imagine ecommerce, social media, any type of tech companies leveraging Foundry to organize, analyze data without the need to dedicate a team to create lower quality internal tools""

As a software engineer myself, I agree with this statement. Arguably, tech products/apps can collect data way more easily (users are literally interacting with them) and I've also seen at both big companies like FANG and startups where they dedicate teams to build mediocre internal tools, which btw Palantir states as their biggest competition in all their sec filings.

Plus, it'd make more sense to start top-down. If Palantir can convince tech companies, boomer companies should naturally follow right? Just like how more boomers are adopting newer apps/tools like Slack for communications, AWS for cloud, etc.

I obviously believe that their management (Thiel, Karp, etc.) is super strong and solid but I can't blindly trust them with my hard-earned money. Seems weird that their business focus on boomers actually do sound like the opposite of a growth story, but rather, way too stubborn with their philosophical beliefs, like how they state that they will not work with China/non-western forces, work with only large companies as they create more impact than SMBs, which is subjectively great in ethical/philosophical sense but does not sound that great in terms of growth and $$$

Am I just over-thinking? Would appreciate some discussion on the stock

Submission,mdvvkm,Opportunity to gain about 10-14% on $MX (Bought out),RowanHarley,"Right now, $MX is trading far below what it was bought out for. It will most likely be bought out for $29, yet is trading at about $25.50 right now. It should be a very easy money grab for anyone who's willing to wait the time. Obviously you should only risk what you're willing to lose, but 10% is always nice to have almost guaranteed, especially with how the market is moving lately. Should be a nice way to recoup some of your losses

F 2020 revenue: ~~$127M~~ $127B

NIO makes 1/100 of revenue of F, but is more valuable than F.

Now, I understand that there's big hype on EVs. But if that's the case, shouldn't F be just as valuable when F also plans to go all electric by 2035?

what advantage does NIO have over F?

* It's Chinese market share?
* Already all electric, while F will be in 15 years? Is F's plan to go all electric too slow?
* Just a massive hype?
* F's mediocre stock performance the past 5 years?

\*Disclaimer, I own NIO and I don't own F.

[The backing of German governments means Volkswagen’s all-out electric push is less risky than it appears](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-the-backing-of-german-governments-means-volkswagens-all-out-electric/)

Excerpt:

> Last week, VW, the world’s biggest automaker, unveiled its Tesla-killer strategy, though in reality the German company is already eating Tesla’s lunch in Europe. Last year, VW became the leading maker of EVs in Europe and sold more of them in that market than Tesla.

Also:

> VW’s all-out bet on diesel has been replaced by an all-out bet on batteries. It looks risky, for a trunk load of reasons. While EV prices will come down as production numbers increase, they might not come down a lot because the costs of the key materials that go into them – steel, nickel, copper, cobalt, lithium, among others – are all surging. EVs remain luxury products.

Focus:

> VW has evidently concluded that its all-EV strategy is less risky than it appears, but you would never get its executives to admit why. In short, the company has close government connections in Germany, and its bankruptcy is unimaginable.

And:

> While the German government itself has no direct VW ownership, it has always treated the company as a crucial partner in a vital industry. The government’s lavish EV purchase incentives, recently extended through 2025, are just one bit of evidence of its affection for its biggest industrial champion.",Company News,,27,t3_me2ira,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/me2ira/globe_and_mail_the_backing_of_german_governments/,13,0.84,[1616805051.0]

Submission,mdvdyu,[DD] Why the GME dream to have retail to fundamentally control the price is wrong.,dwpunch,"Saw a bunch of comments over at r/WSB that ""WE CONTROL THE PRICE.""  If we say it's worth $100,000 then it is!  This is misguided and I wrote up a response:

You're sort of right. Yes in theory the market could collectively decide that GME is worth $1M a share and if every owner of a share banded together and could enforce this price, a cartel on GME shares would be formed.

There's a problem with this though, first one is what actually could happen if the cartel succeeds but I'll get to that later. This requires a mechanism to enforce discipline on every single holder of GME. Right now traders can buy dips, pretend to be on the train then sell, rinse and repeat, dip and rip.

You might ask, what if the true diamond handers NEVER sell? Then eventually the question arises, when to jump off? At some point you must take a profit right? But as soon as people believe that people are jumping off, no one wants to buy it. So no one wants to be the bagholder. Since market participants are forward looking some people will sell before this event. It's a catch 22, in order to horde shares you can't sell. But to make money you have to sell at some point.

Another problem is how GME executives are likely to act when the shares become $1M or whatever you want it to be. They can issue shares because capital is basically free. They already announced this in the 10K

>Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM (at-the-market) Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives and general working capital needs.

Can you blame them? If the stock price becomes stupidly high, that's just free capital for bonus / comping high talent new hires, transforming the company towards e-commerce, etc. This creates new shares that requires the cartel to keep buying.",Company Analysis,,153,t3_mdvdyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdvdyu/dd_why_the_gme_dream_to_have_retail_to/,10,0.55,[1616784192.0]

Moving forward, for the last few months, it's been pretty apparent that Nasdaq has been struggling to stay above 13,000 while all the other indexes have continued to rally on higher.

**Let's look at the monthly chart first:** (yellow line is the 13,000 level)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/KbOw6JrK/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KbOw6JrK/)

Since the start of 2021, Nasdaq has successfully traded above 13,000 at various points, but for January and February, it still managed to find itself under that level at the close of the candle. We've basically seen two doji candles in a row now, and the month of March is seemingly turning into another doji.

**Let's look at the weekly chart now:**

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZtrtVUm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZtrtVUm/) 

Ever since the correction began for Nasdaq, there has been a struggle in closing above 13,000 on the weekly chart. Four weeks in a row, Nasdaq traded above 13k at some point in the week, only to find itself under that level at candle close. We came really close on Friday on finally rallying through it and possibly closing above it, but we fall short at 12,966.75.

**Thesis:**

Personally, I believe that recapturing and closing above 13,000 will be the signal we are looking for that there will be strength coming back into tech. It begins with the closing of the March candle this coming week. There are only a few days left in the month, so there is an opportunity to finally break this trend by closing above. 

This coming week, if we finally close the monthly candle above 13k, and then the weekly candle also manages to close above it, I would personally say that we should begin to see a renewed rally in tech for the month of April.",Advice,,6,t3_mec5yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mec5yn/nasdaqs_battle_with_13000/,10,0.72,[1616845350.0]

However, I like volatile stocks so I try not to day trade at all but I might partake if I see a good opportunity since you can do 4 of them within a week (from what I understand) and then I'm careful after that till the next week. So, from what I've read I took it to mean that I can do up to 4 round trips within a week and that's all I have to be careful of. BUT then I was reading some other restrictions that leads me to believe I'm closer to being banned from daytrading for 90 days or whatever, like you can't buy and sell the same stock at all within several days without adding to the invisible pattern day trading tally and other things that weren't refuted by anyone else (which makes me think they're right).

So for an example, say I buy 5 shares of a $10 stock Monday and then sell them at the end of the day when they're $20. That's one round trip, right? That's all I thought a day trade was, trades that were round trip on the same day. Then, after reading more, it seems the ""4 round trips within a week"" means I can't buy a stock on Monday, and then sell it on Tuesday-Friday (as that's a round trip within a week) which is WAY more restricting and I'm surprised I haven't been banned yet.

Submission,mdzyga,Experiment: Selling Covered Calls as a Way of Long Term Growth,rwtdog,"Theory: By selling covered calls on virtually any stock(in this case VXX) you can vastly outperform the market over both the long and short term.

How it started: While I was holding around 1600 CRSR shares and slowly watching them go down post-earnings call, I started looking into selling covered calls on my shares as a way to recoup losses and lower my average cost per share by buying more shares with the premiums. The idea was to sell the calls just above my buy-in price so that no matter what I would get to keep the premium and worst-case scenario if they were executed, I would still make a meager profit on the sales of the shares. After doing this a couple of times, I started to wonder what the potential downsides of this strategy are. The first one was obvious, since all the money was in one business, if something happened overnight and that business went bankrupt(EX: Enron) then you would lose everything because the shares would be worth nothing and you can't sell any more options. After this, I struggle to find another downside with this strategy.

\*\*The Solution\*\*

In order to eliminate the single stock risk, I started to look at ETFs. The one I settled on was VXX for a couple of reasons. The 1st reason is that VXX is currently at/near an all-time low. This helps lower the risk of the shares devaluing over time and becoming worthless. The 2nd is because while I know I am not smart enough to time the market, I am smart enough to know that at some point in the short to mid-term future the market will need to correct. VXX is the perfect insulation against this because as the market falls and volatility increases, VXX will increase in price. As an added bonus, since VXX is an index that tracks the volatility of the market it inherently has a higher volatility than other stocks and thus has higher option premiums.

\*\*The Experiment\*\*

On Tuesday, March 23rd I decided to pull the trigger and attempt my theory. I put around $54,000 inot VXX for a total of around 4,300 shares at an average of $12.05. After this, I sold 43 3/26 $12.50 options for $20 each for a total of $860 and reinvest into more VXX shares. The options expired worthless today and I kept the $860 and will do the same thing this Monday. If the options were to be worth $20 each and expire worthless every week and I \*\*DON'T\*\* reinvest anything into more shares over the course of a year then I would net $44,720 in additional money for a return of nearly 83%.

Now, I am not naive enough to think that they will expire worthless every week, but in the event that they do get executed and have only gone slightly above the execution price, I can simply rebuy fewer shares and start the process over again. Should the ticker skyrocket overnight(entirely possible with VXX) then I will simply sit on my cash and wait for it to come back down to more normal levels.

\*\*The Question\*\*

IMO, this scenario doesn't leave any possibility of me taking a long-term loss and a very slim possibility of a short-term realized loss. While I am not saying that I have cracked the code and found some genius way to make free money, I do think that the fact that there is SO much room between 83% returns \*\*WITH NO REINVESTMENT\*\* and the average 7% return of the market that it is highly likely that this theory would easily beat the market returns and likely be above a 20% return a year.

\*\*Please tell me what I have done wrong or not thought of.\*\*

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am now aware that VXX isn't the right stock to be doing this with long-term. Appreciate the insight and would like to know how you would feel about it if it was a different stock/etf that isn't predestined to continually go down in the future.

TLDR: Too much stuff to go through

Submission,mdsfjo,Can someone point out to me what i'm missing here in this options trading strategy?,Manyworldsz,"Let me know if this is not the place to ask and if so, my apologies.

As a European I recently started experimenting with buying calls and puts. One of the things I tried a few times now and worked out every time is the long straddle: I buy an ATM or slightly OTM call and put at the same time for a stock that is volatile enough but not too much. One that's likely to be going up or down a few percentages over the course of one or a couple of days. Pretty easy to find in European stocks (I did this with MT). Expiration date at least a couple weeks ahead. Then I just wait for it to go up or down enough so I'm gaining more than losing (either way it goes, eventually you will gain more than you lose as you can only lose 100% of the premium, but gain multitudes.

I found that with this stock the price only needs to move 2% for me to already have more gains than losses. I sell at 2.5-3% change to get at least 5% gains out of it, including all costs.

This just seems too easy... The chance of the stock not moving 2.5% either way before theta decay starts eating away too much seems really small. So it feels like i'm taking close to zero risk for pretty consistent gains. I need to add so far the stock always moved up so I got profits from the call. Maybe if  it goes down it needs to swing further for the put to make a profit? Is there something I'm not seeing here?",,,9,t3_mdsfjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdsfjo/can_someone_point_out_to_me_what_im_missing_here/,3,0.71,[1616776047.0]

Submission,mea57x,VOO + VTI vs. QQQM + QQQJ + VTI... 20+ year long term portfolio (DD),DaddyDersch,"I am in the process of finalizing exactly what i want me portfolio to look like i want it to be simple, diversified, safe and efficient. 

VTI is my main holding at 70%. That will not change. I allocated 10% to stocks (my play/ fun/ risk), 5% to SCHD for dividends/ mostly value stocks, 5% to SMH (semi conductors), and 5% to VIS (Vanguard industrials) due to VTIs lack if industrials plus i believe infrastructure will be a big thing year over year. So that leaves me with 5% to go. 

I am debating on whether that is better allocated to tech heavy QQQM and QQQJ or VOO. 

QQQM
This is the alternative to QQQ but has a lower daily volume and expenses ratio. They are identical, however, QQQ does hold one more stock than QQQM according to a few tools I've seen and this does result in a higher performance for QQQ (less than 1%) 

Tracks nadaq top 100 stocks 
Tech weight- 63%
ER- 0.15% 
YTD- (-)0.47%
1 year- 71% 
5 year- 24%
10 year- 20%

QQQJ 

Tracks nasdaq 100-200 stocks. 
ER- 0.15%
YTD- 1.67% 
1 year- 18% 
Unfortunately this ETF is new and doesnt have any more performance data. 

Average YTD return- 0.59% 
Average 1 year return- 45% 

VOO

Tracks the top 500 of the S&P. 

Tech weight= 34%. 
ER- 0.03% 
YTD- 4%
1 year- 62%
5 year- 16%
10 year- 14% 


Performances wise Voo best QQQM/J over the last year however QQQ has best VOO year over year. 

7 of the top 10 holds of VOO (~23%)/ QQQ (~44%) are the same however hold they hold a much heavier weight in QQQ.

79 of QQQMs 103 holdings and 42 of QQQJs holdings are in VOO for a total of 121 holdings for abouts a 60% find overlap. 



This is where im not really sure which is best for me. 

On one had QQQM/QQQJ have consistently out performed VTI while VOO has fallen just short or been withing <1%. 

QQQM/J is much heavier into tech than VOO. which i believe to be a downside in the long 15-20 year hold (6 months ago I wouldn't have thought that but this correction we are in has humbled me). VOO does provide a much better diversification than QQQM/J while still being overweight in tech. 

The lower ER of VOO is a nice bonus. 

VOO does also have about 0.5% higher dividend pay out than QQQM/J put together. 

VOO is 98% large cap stocks while QQQM is 100% large cap but QQQJ is primarily Mid/ small (no actual weight available when i researched).

Note- due to VOOs S&p weighting it has survived this dip we are in much better than QQQM/J, however, has the S&P rises to new highs will we see a pull back thatll wash that fact out...?

In the end which is better is the question. 

Someone who believes in tech and or believes in up and coming tech could be easily persuaded to QQQM/QQQJ. 

While someone looking for diversification and less risk while still toting a nice return would be interested in the 500 holding VOO. 

Which will out perform the other over the next 20 years? Well that is a good question. 

Right now after this DD.... I am leaning towards QQQM/J. but i also am very tempted by VOO due to its wider holdings, lower ER and performance.",Industry Discussion,,5,t3_mea57x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mea57x/voo_vti_vs_qqqm_qqqj_vti_20_year_long_term/,5,0.86,[1616835664.0]

Salesforcehas been beaten up since their Slack acquisition. I'm anticipating a retest of previous highs before the end of 2021 and have placed my bets accordingly. I'm long a 260 call with Jan 2022 expiration and have been selling 285 calls against it since purchase almost 60 days ago. My current cost basis for the call is $2100 making my break even 281. 

Based on current PE of crm it is trading at a 100 percent discount to it's 5 year average signaling a potential run to $400/ share is not out of the question.

Obviously hindsight is 20/20 and id love to get long the 260s from their current prices of like $900. But I'm still confident my bet will at the very least break even, especially with my call selling against it. How unrealistic are my expectations? Poke holes in my optimism.

Submission,mdv86z,Can anyone recommend an app for *reliable* stock notifications on iPhone?,KNOXHARRlNGTON,"can anyone recommend an app for \*reliable\* stock notifications on iPhone? I want a notification pushed to iphone every 1 minute with an update on a stock. yahoo finance is quite reliable as far as relatively instant notifications, but you can only get notification by setting a price, and even with that, it just works once and then the alert expires and you have to set a new one.

&#x200B;

And I dont want the alert to be timed to a stock’s price, I want it to be tied to a time interval and therefore send me an update for a every defined time increment (such as every 1 minutes). I want this update to to push to my notifications on iPhone because then that pushes to my watch, and i can just go about my day, yet always be able to just check my watch to see whats going on with my stock of choice. If anyone can reccomend an app I would be greatly appreciate. I tried Stockmaster (even paid for it) and the notifications are horrible, they literally come in whenever they feel like it, minutes, sometimes hours later.",,,9,t3_mdv86z,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdv86z/can_anyone_recommend_an_app_for_reliable_stock/,2,0.75,[1616783730.0]

I just received my k-1 in the mail in regards to buying UVXY shares in 2020. I bought 115 shares total $1277. Sold it that same day, it was only like a $20 gain lol. Anyway, I already did my 2020 taxes and that transaction was part of my 1099 that I filed. 

On the K-1 on Line L capital contributed is 1277 while withdrawals and distributions is (1277).

Everything else on the form is blank or zeros. 

Line 8 in part 3, “net short term capital gain (loss) is 0 which makes me lead to believe I don’t have to do anything.

Submission,me37ft,How to best trade/invest $184K when I have $188K in student loans?,archenon,"I'm about to receive a large inflow of cash on the order of $184K due to a recent settlement. I also have $188K in student loans, but there is NO INTEREST accruing until the end of September. I'm trying to figure out the best way to take advantage of this cash while also mitigating risk.

I'm not looking to yolo the money or anything, but throwing the money into an index or ETF also seems to slow. I've thought about just selling covered calls until then, although I'm not sure what stocks to buy.

Any ideas on the best way to do this so at the end of September I'll have a decent chunk of change to pay off my loans and also have some left over?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Just to be clear, my loans are interest free until September 30th 2021. I have six months until interest starts again. I think there's some confusion in the comments, of course I would pay my loan off the moment I get my check if the interest is actively accruing right now. Also edited my post to make this more clear.

EDIT 2:

Just for more information, currently financial situation besides the debt is fairly stable. $20K in savings, $20K in Roth, $16K in stocks, living at home until summer with no non-recreational expenses, making mid five figures until I finish my fellowhship program next year and then I can expect to make six figures.

I read that I’m able to sell before or on the date listed but I’m confused about the number differences. For example on TD Ameritrade AMC it shows 4.50 then on each side it has two different amounts 5.45, 6.45 and on the other 0.00 & 0.0100. What do these mean & what does strikes mean. Do I just gamble to bet against if the stock will rise above the price given to me? What does calls & puts mean. I’m interested in investing in AMC & GME.

Submission,me9zg9,Initial Thoughts on Trinity Bank,mnetoo0,"The rest of the write-up is at: https://netosnotes.blogspot.com/2021/03/trinity-bank.html

Trinity was founded in May of 2003 by Jeffrey Harp. It started with just over $11 million in capital from 258 people in his circle of friends in Tarrant County, Texas.

Founder and CEO, Jeffrey Harp, was previously CEO of Summit Bancshares, where he spent 16 years. Summit was a 138-year-old bank that was acquired by Frost in 2006. When Summit was acquired, it had over $900 million in deposits. Much like Frost and Trinity, albeit to a lesser extent, Summit also made most of its loans to businesses (both C&I and owner-occupied CRE) and had a cheap source of funding – given that most deposits were non-interest-bearing demand deposits from banks. Whether we are talking about the loan book, the securities book, earning asset’s duration, the source of deposits or leverage, the three banks are similar.  

(...)

I would say that the main difference between Frost and Trinity in terms of culture and business model, is that Trinity has a much sharper focus on keeping costs low. Assets per employee at Trinity are $13 million versus $7 million at Frost and $6 million at similarly sized (compared to Trinity) banks. The fact that Trinity does a lot with little is achieved by basically leveraging their fixed costs at their only branch. Much like a hedge fund, the contribution margin of increasing assets becomes bigger and bigger, until more branches, etc. are needed. Trinity opened in May of 2003 with 13 employees. They managed to work with 13 employees until the balance sheet grew to $215 million in deposits. In practical terms, this translates into non-interest expense (rent, salaries, etc.) as percentage of average assets of 1.5% versus 2.7% for peer banks and 2.3% for banks with $1-3bn in assets. Curiously, net non-interest expense is 1.3% at Trinity versus 2.2% at peer banks and 1.4% at larger banks (which typically charge more fees).",Company Discussion,,1,t3_me9zg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/me9zg9/initial_thoughts_on_trinity_bank/,1,0.6,[1616834834.0]

Basically I've been sitting in cash and waiting for a certain % drop in a few stocks/ETFs I like. I'm mainly buy SOXL with a few options. I will buy and sell within a few days and am sitting in cash again. After a month I'm up $10k but I'm concerned about wash sales and taxes.

For example buying and selling the same stock:

3/1 Buy: 1000 @ $30

3/5 Sell: 1000 @ $40

Net : +$10000


3/7 Buy: 1000 @ $35

3/9 Sell: 1000 @ $25

Net : -$10000


3/25 Buy: 1000 @ $20

After the first 2 trades I'm back to $30k and have netted $0. Do I owe taxes on the $10,000 in profits because the $10,000 loss is a wash?
